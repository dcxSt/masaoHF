00:00:08,930 --> 00:00:08,940
that has kind of boogered my mind for a

longer the list is the more random it is

98
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:17,530
longer the list is the more random it is
 

99

103
00:03:20,590 --> 00:03:22,949
is going to be more of the most
important I mean obviously the more

104
00:03:22,949 --> 00:03:22,959
important I mean obviously the more
 

105
00:03:22,959 --> 00:03:25,140
important I mean obviously the more
racist predispositions you have the more

106
00:03:25,140 --> 00:03:25,150
racist predispositions you have the more
 

107
00:03:25,150 --> 00:03:28,170
racist predispositions you have the more
race is going to be you know at the top

108
00:03:28,170 --> 00:03:28,180
race is going to be you know at the top
 

109
00:03:28,180 --> 00:03:30,690
race is going to be you know at the top
but you know it's it's all relative you

110
00:03:30,690 --> 00:03:30,700
but you know it's it's all relative you
 

111
00:03:30,700 --> 00:03:31,860
but you know it's it's all relative you
can have some things are going to be

112
00:03:31,860 --> 00:03:31,870
can have some things are going to be
 

113
00:03:31,870 --> 00:03:33,479
can have some things are going to be
more importance on things less important

114
00:03:33,479 --> 00:03:33,489
more importance on things less important
 

115
00:03:33,489 --> 00:03:35,759
more importance on things less important
whatever but the more you know the less

116
00:03:35,759 --> 00:03:35,769
whatever but the more you know the less
 

117
00:03:35,769 --> 00:03:38,879
whatever but the more you know the less
likely you are to be prejudiced about

118
00:03:38,879 --> 00:03:38,889
likely you are to be prejudiced about
 

119
00:03:38,889 --> 00:03:41,839
likely you are to be prejudiced about
this guy and that's why you know I think

120
00:03:41,839 --> 00:03:41,849
this guy and that's why you know I think
 

121
00:03:41,849 --> 00:03:44,309
this guy and that's why you know I think
when you have a politician like Obama

122
00:03:44,309 --> 00:03:44,319
when you have a politician like Obama
 

123
00:03:44,319 --> 00:03:47,309
when you have a politician like Obama
maybe at first he might be disadvantaged

124
00:03:47,309 --> 00:03:47,319
maybe at first he might be disadvantaged
 

125
00:03:47,319 --> 00:03:50,190
maybe at first he might be disadvantaged
because he's half black but after people

126
00:03:50,190 --> 00:03:50,200
because he's half black but after people
 

127
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:52,020
because he's half black but after people
see him on TV so often that they think

128
00:03:52,020 --> 00:03:52,030
see him on TV so often that they think
 

129
00:03:52,030 --> 00:03:54,659
see him on TV so often that they think
that you know that TV's broken if he's

130
00:03:54,659 --> 00:03:54,669
that you know that TV's broken if he's
 

131
00:03:54,669 --> 00:03:58,379
that you know that TV's broken if he's
not on it then perhaps you know at this

132
00:03:58,379 --> 00:03:58,389
not on it then perhaps you know at this
 

133
00:03:58,389 --> 00:04:00,300
not on it then perhaps you know at this
point race doesn't matter as much as it

134
00:04:00,300 --> 00:04:00,310
point race doesn't matter as much as it
 

135
00:04:00,310 --> 00:04:02,909
point race doesn't matter as much as it
might have before because they know so

136
00:04:02,909 --> 00:04:02,919
might have before because they know so
 

137
00:04:02,919 --> 00:04:05,370
might have before because they know so
much about him that you know it doesn't

138
00:04:05,370 --> 00:04:05,380
much about him that you know it doesn't
 

139
00:04:05,380 --> 00:04:06,809
much about him that you know it doesn't
really matter anymore because they got a

140
00:04:06,809 --> 00:04:06,819
really matter anymore because they got a
 

141
00:04:06,819 --> 00:04:09,839
really matter anymore because they got a
long list of things so I think that's

142
00:04:09,839 --> 00:04:09,849
long list of things so I think that's
 

143
00:04:09,849 --> 00:04:12,870
long list of things so I think that's
really the only way to defeat racism is

144
00:04:12,870 --> 00:04:12,880
really the only way to defeat racism is
 

145
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:15,569
really the only way to defeat racism is
to get to know people because the more

146
00:04:15,569 --> 00:04:15,579
to get to know people because the more
 

147
00:04:15,579 --> 00:04:18,719
to get to know people because the more
you know about people the the more stuff

148
00:04:18,719 --> 00:04:18,729
you know about people the the more stuff
 

149
00:04:18,729 --> 00:04:21,180
you know about people the the more stuff
you've got to evaluate that guy I mean

150
00:04:21,180 --> 00:04:21,190
you've got to evaluate that guy I mean
 

151
00:04:21,190 --> 00:04:25,020
you've got to evaluate that guy I mean
maybe you hate blacks maybe like Oilers

152
00:04:25,020 --> 00:04:25,030
