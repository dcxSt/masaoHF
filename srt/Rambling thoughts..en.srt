and can't like separation between things
 

57
00:02:22,730 --> 00:02:30,670
and can't like separation between things
and it's like this thing is so small if

58
00:02:30,670 --> 00:02:30,680
and it's like this thing is so small if
 

59
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:34,870
and it's like this thing is so small if
you go to see a little piece of ceramic

60
00:02:34,870 --> 00:02:34,880
you go to see a little piece of ceramic
 

61
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:39,610
you go to see a little piece of ceramic
tile just a mile away in comparing sizes

62
00:02:39,610 --> 00:02:39,620
tile just a mile away in comparing sizes
 

63
00:02:39,620 --> 00:02:41,670
tile just a mile away in comparing sizes
it's like if you're in another planet

64
00:02:41,670 --> 00:02:41,680
it's like if you're in another planet
 

65
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:47,070
it's like if you're in another planet
it's like the people here the little

it's like the people here the little
 

67
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:54,090

spot and that public toilet a mile away
 

75
00:03:01,850 --> 00:03:07,420
spot and that public toilet a mile away
from here and it's just the real thing

76
00:03:07,420 --> 00:03:07,430
from here and it's just the real thing
 

77
00:03:07,430 --> 00:03:15,820
from here and it's just the real thing
as normal reality because you know we

78
00:03:15,820 --> 00:03:15,830
as normal reality because you know we
 

79
00:03:15,830 --> 00:03:18,910
as normal reality because you know we
kind of live outside of it reality is

80
00:03:18,910 --> 00:03:18,920
kind of live outside of it reality is
 

81
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:22,330
kind of live outside of it reality is
sort of there next to us but at the same

82
00:03:22,330 --> 00:03:22,340
sort of there next to us but at the same
 

83
00:03:22,340 --> 00:03:32,800
sort of there next to us but at the same
time it's kind of like we only see what

84
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:32,810
time it's kind of like we only see what
 

85
00:03:32,810 --> 00:03:34,960
time it's kind of like we only see what
we can rebuild from the little

86
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:34,970
we can rebuild from the little
 

87
00:03:34,970 --> 00:03:39,880
we can rebuild from the little
information we get you know we can only

88
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:39,890
information we get you know we can only
 

89
00:03:39,890 --> 00:03:46,990
information we get you know we can only
see and hear smell and touch and the

90
00:03:46,990 --> 00:03:47,000
see and hear smell and touch and the
 

91
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:56,470
see and hear smell and touch and the
little information that we get is you

92
00:03:56,470 --> 00:03:56,480
little information that we get is you
 

93
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:59,760
little information that we get is you
know reinterpreted and we kind of

94
00:03:59,760 --> 00:03:59,770
know reinterpreted and we kind of
 

95
00:03:59,770 --> 00:04:04,860
know reinterpreted and we kind of
artificially create an image to guess

96
00:04:04,860 --> 00:04:04,870
artificially create an image to guess
 

97
00:04:04,870 --> 00:04:12,850
artificially create an image to guess
what reality is like but you know we

98
00:04:12,850 --> 00:04:12,860
what reality is like but you know we
 

99
00:04:12,860 --> 00:04:14,809
what reality is like but you know we
don't really

100
00:04:14,809 --> 00:04:14,819
don't really
 

101
00:04:14,819 --> 00:04:21,140
don't really
see beyond what we do see it's all like

102
00:04:21,140 --> 00:04:21,150
see beyond what we do see it's all like
 

103
00:04:21,150 --> 00:04:35,270
see beyond what we do see it's all like
a faraway or something kind of green

104
00:04:35,270 --> 00:04:35,280
a faraway or something kind of green
 

105
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:37,430

109
00:04:39,930 --> 00:04:45,890
person's gray not green I don't know why
this stuff over there looks green this

110
00:04:45,890 --> 00:04:45,900
this stuff over there looks green this
 

111
00:04:45,900 --> 00:04:48,909
this stuff over there looks green this
looks like you know some kind of a

112
00:04:48,909 --> 00:04:48,919
looks like you know some kind of a
 

113
00:04:48,919 --> 00:04:52,640
looks like you know some kind of a
botanical garden in a building after was

114
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:52,650
botanical garden in a building after was
 

115
00:04:52,650 --> 00:04:55,189
botanical garden in a building after was
hit by missiles you know you can kind of

116
00:04:55,189 --> 00:04:55,199
hit by missiles you know you can kind of
 

117
00:04:55,199 --> 00:04:58,129
hit by missiles you know you can kind of
imagine like these little rooms of

118
00:04:58,129 --> 00:04:58,139
imagine like these little rooms of
 

119
00:04:58,139 --> 00:05:00,680
imagine like these little rooms of
things that used to be there you know

120
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:00,690
things that used to be there you know
 

121
00:05:00,690 --> 00:05:03,050
things that used to be there you know
that little yellow thing far in a

122
00:05:03,050 --> 00:05:03,060
that little yellow thing far in a
 

123
00:05:03,060 --> 00:05:05,210
that little yellow thing far in a
distance could be a teddy bear that fell

124
00:05:05,210 --> 00:05:05,220
distance could be a teddy bear that fell
 

125
00:05:05,220 --> 00:05:06,890
distance could be a teddy bear that fell
off a little girl's room or something

126
00:05:06,890 --> 00:05:06,900
off a little girl's room or something
 

127
00:05:06,900 --> 00:05:15,230
off a little girl's room or something
after the bomb fell reality's a funny

128
00:05:15,230 --> 00:05:15,240
after the bomb fell reality's a funny
 

129
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:19,240
after the bomb fell reality's a funny
thing see all these little things and

130
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:19,250
thing see all these little things and
 

131
00:05:19,250 --> 00:05:23,230
thing see all these little things and
inside you each of these little dots

132
00:05:23,230 --> 00:05:23,240
inside you each of these little dots
 

133
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:28,279
inside you each of these little dots
there could be something so small like

134
00:05:28,279 --> 00:05:28,289
there could be something so small like
 

135
00:05:28,289 --> 00:05:37,339
there could be something so small like
you can't even see it and no tools can

136
00:05:37,339 --> 00:05:37,349
you can't even see it and no tools can
 

137
00:05:37,349 --> 00:05:43,670
you can't even see it and no tools can
detect it but it's as complex as the

138
00:05:43,670 --> 00:05:43,680
detect it but it's as complex as the
 

139
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:47,480
detect it but it's as complex as the
star system when all those thingies that

140
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:47,490
star system when all those thingies that
 

141
00:05:47,490 --> 00:05:52,250
star system when all those thingies that
goes on and and elections and organized

142
00:05:52,250 --> 00:05:52,260
goes on and and elections and organized
 

143
00:05:52,260 --> 00:06:01,840
goes on and and elections and organized
crime and and volcanoes and whatever

145
00:06:01,850 --> 00:06:04,720

it's like they're layers of existence

146
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:04,730
it's like they're layers of existence
 

147
00:06:04,730 --> 00:06:09,850
it's like they're layers of existence
you know we only see one layer and we

148
00:06:09,850 --> 00:06:09,860
you know we only see one layer and we
 

149
00:06:09,860 --> 00:06:15,660
you know we only see one layer and we
give meaning to things that are simple

150
00:06:15,660 --> 00:06:15,670
give meaning to things that are simple
 

151
00:06:15,670 --> 00:06:24,210
give meaning to things that are simple
manifestations of the laws of physics

152
00:06:24,210 --> 00:06:24,220

 

153
00:06:24,220 --> 00:06:28,290

because we reconstruct everything we see

154
00:06:28,290 --> 00:06:28,300
because we reconstruct everything we see
 

155
00:06:28,300 --> 00:06:42,690
because we reconstruct everything we see
we make this like wait smells good

156
00:06:42,690 --> 00:06:42,700
we make this like wait smells good
 

157
00:06:42,700 --> 00:06:59,320
we make this like wait smells good
rubbing alcohol you know computers have

158
00:06:59,320 --> 00:06:59,330
rubbing alcohol you know computers have
 

159
00:06:59,330 --> 00:07:03,820
rubbing alcohol you know computers have
shown us something funny when you have a

160
00:07:03,820 --> 00:07:03,830
shown us something funny when you have a
 

161
00:07:03,830 --> 00:07:06,940
shown us something funny when you have a
computer simulation say you have a video

162
00:07:06,940 --> 00:07:06,950
computer simulation say you have a video
 

163
00:07:06,950 --> 00:07:10,870
computer simulation say you have a video
game in your computer and it's a 3d you

164
00:07:10,870 --> 00:07:10,880
game in your computer and it's a 3d you
 

165
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:14,290
game in your computer and it's a 3d you
know environment you can make it

166
00:07:14,290 --> 00:07:14,300
know environment you can make it
 

167
00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:18,820
know environment you can make it
character run away and travel in a

168
00:07:18,820 --> 00:07:18,830
character run away and travel in a
 

169
00:07:18,830 --> 00:07:25,320
character run away and travel in a
distance forever and he'll across

170
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:25,330
distance forever and he'll across
 

171
00:07:25,330 --> 00:07:30,960
distance forever and he'll across
tremendous distances but he will never

172
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:30,970
tremendous distances but he will never
 

173
00:07:30,970 --> 00:07:36,340
tremendous distances but he will never
get out of that simulation because he is

174
00:07:36,340 --> 00:07:36,350
get out of that simulation because he is
 

175
00:07:36,350 --> 00:07:40,270
get out of that simulation because he is
part of it he exists in the same way

176
00:07:40,270 --> 00:07:40,280
part of it he exists in the same way
 

177
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:44,680
part of it he exists in the same way
that the simulation does he is just

178
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:44,690
that the simulation does he is just
 

179
00:07:44,690 --> 00:07:52,570
that the simulation does he is just
binary numbers in your computer just the

180
00:07:52,570 --> 00:07:52,580
binary numbers in your computer just the
 

181
00:07:52,580 --> 00:07:56,260
binary numbers in your computer just the
same as the warranty lives and that's

182
00:07:56,260 --> 00:07:56,270
same as the warranty lives and that's
 

183
00:07:56,270 --> 00:08:00,970
same as the warranty lives and that's
why this guy is stuck in that simulation

184
00:08:00,970 --> 00:08:00,980
why this guy is stuck in that simulation
 

185
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:05,950
why this guy is stuck in that simulation
and the only way he can exist outside of

186
00:08:05,950 --> 00:08:05,960
and the only way he can exist outside of
 

187
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:10,020
and the only way he can exist outside of
it as if a copy of himself is created

188
00:08:10,020 --> 00:08:10,030
it as if a copy of himself is created
 

189
00:08:10,030 --> 00:08:13,160
it as if a copy of himself is created
but it'll never be him

190
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:13,170
but it'll never be him
 

191
00:08:13,170 --> 00:08:15,750
but it'll never be him
you'll never see him pop out of his

192
00:08:15,750 --> 00:08:15,760
you'll never see him pop out of his
 

193
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:20,490
you'll never see him pop out of his
interior screen and appear in your

194
00:08:20,490 --> 00:08:20,500
interior screen and appear in your
 

195
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:28,950
interior screen and appear in your
bedroom and that's the same for us in a

196
00:08:28,950 --> 00:08:28,960
bedroom and that's the same for us in a
 

197
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:30,620
bedroom and that's the same for us in a
way don't you think

198
00:08:30,620 --> 00:08:30,630
way don't you think
 

199
00:08:30,630 --> 00:08:36,300
way don't you think
we're made of the same thing the world

200
00:08:36,300 --> 00:08:36,310
we're made of the same thing the world
 

201
00:08:36,310 --> 00:08:39,810
we're made of the same thing the world
we live in is made of and that's why we

202
00:08:39,810 --> 00:08:39,820
we live in is made of and that's why we
 

203
00:08:39,820 --> 00:08:50,790
we live in is made of and that's why we
can only exist in it but it doesn't have

204
00:08:50,790 --> 00:08:50,800
can only exist in it but it doesn't have
 

205
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:55,620
can only exist in it but it doesn't have
to be so far away things that are hidden

206
00:08:55,620 --> 00:08:55,630
to be so far away things that are hidden
 

207
00:08:55,630 --> 00:08:59,520
to be so far away things that are hidden
from us could simply be too small or too

208
00:08:59,520 --> 00:08:59,530
from us could simply be too small or too
 

209
00:08:59,530 --> 00:09:03,620
from us could simply be too small or too
big it's funny

210
00:09:03,620 --> 00:09:03,630
big it's funny
 

211
00:09:03,630 --> 00:09:10,020
big it's funny
how an atom works in much the same way

212
00:09:10,020 --> 00:09:10,030
how an atom works in much the same way
 

213
00:09:10,030 --> 00:09:20,480
how an atom works in much the same way
as a solar system maybe that's the point

214
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:20,490

 

215
00:09:20,490 --> 00:09:25,080

it's a different layer on one layer you

216
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:25,090
it's a different layer on one layer you
 

217
00:09:25,090 --> 00:09:35,400
it's a different layer on one layer you
see a guy smiling at you

218
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:35,410

 

219
00:09:35,410 --> 00:09:38,939

and you interpret it for what it is

220
00:09:38,939 --> 00:09:38,949
and you interpret it for what it is
 

221
00:09:38,949 --> 00:09:41,789
and you interpret it for what it is
supposed to mean based on the

222
00:09:41,789 --> 00:09:41,799
supposed to mean based on the
 

223
00:09:41,799 --> 00:09:46,319
supposed to mean based on the
information that you have based on your

224
00:09:46,319 --> 00:09:46,329
information that you have based on your
 

225
00:09:46,329 --> 00:09:49,999
information that you have based on your
own experience based on what you think

226
00:09:49,999 --> 00:09:50,009
own experience based on what you think
 

227
00:09:50,009 --> 00:09:54,569
own experience based on what you think
you're seeing that's one layer

228
00:09:54,569 --> 00:09:54,579
you're seeing that's one layer
 

229
00:09:54,579 --> 00:09:59,879
you're seeing that's one layer
it's our layer the human layer but there

230
00:09:59,879 --> 00:09:59,889
it's our layer the human layer but there
 

231
00:09:59,889 --> 00:10:06,139
it's our layer the human layer but there
are others in another layer there's a

232
00:10:06,139 --> 00:10:06,149
are others in another layer there's a
 

233
00:10:06,149 --> 00:10:09,149
are others in another layer there's a
thing so complex going on that you could

234
00:10:09,149 --> 00:10:09,159
thing so complex going on that you could
 

235
00:10:09,159 --> 00:10:11,460
thing so complex going on that you could
fill the entire encyclopedia dramatica

236
00:10:11,460 --> 00:10:11,470
fill the entire encyclopedia dramatica
 

237
00:10:11,470 --> 00:10:17,929
fill the entire encyclopedia dramatica
with it all the little wave patterns

238
00:10:17,929 --> 00:10:17,939
with it all the little wave patterns
 

239
00:10:17,939 --> 00:10:21,749
with it all the little wave patterns
building up in his brain leading to his

240
00:10:21,749 --> 00:10:21,759
building up in his brain leading to his
 

241
00:10:21,759 --> 00:10:25,609
building up in his brain leading to his
mouth muscles moving and forming a smile

242
00:10:25,609 --> 00:10:25,619
mouth muscles moving and forming a smile
 

243
00:10:25,619 --> 00:10:30,479
mouth muscles moving and forming a smile
such a complex thing but that's not our

244
00:10:30,479 --> 00:10:30,489
such a complex thing but that's not our
 

245
00:10:30,489 --> 00:10:33,199
such a complex thing but that's not our
layer that's not the world we live in

246
00:10:33,199 --> 00:10:33,209
layer that's not the world we live in
 

247
00:10:33,209 --> 00:10:37,819
layer that's not the world we live in
the world we live in is the one in which

248
00:10:37,819 --> 00:10:37,829
the world we live in is the one in which
 

249
00:10:37,829 --> 00:10:40,789
the world we live in is the one in which
it's just some dude smiling at you

it's just some dude smiling at you
 

251
00:10:40,799 --> 00:10:52,829
it's just some dude smiling at you
that's all this yeah thing this guy is

252
00:10:52,829 --> 00:10:52,839
that's all this yeah thing this guy is
 

253
00:10:52,839 --> 00:10:53,779
that's all this yeah thing this guy is
dead or something

254
00:10:53,779 --> 00:10:53,789
dead or something
 

255

dead or something
whatever
