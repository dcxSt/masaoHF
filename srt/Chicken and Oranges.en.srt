because normally I would put the thing
 

89
00:03:55,990 --> 00:04:00,630
because normally I would put the thing
in there and leave it overnight in in a

90
00:04:00,630 --> 00:04:00,640
in there and leave it overnight in in a

I think the hot water is going to make

106
00:05:06,540 --> 00:05:06,550
I think the hot water is going to make
 

107
00:05:06,550 --> 00:05:12,400
I think the hot water is going to make
the chicken sort of softer

108
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:12,410

 

109
00:05:12,410 --> 00:05:15,830

it's sort of squish here see it kind of
 

117
00:05:38,940 --> 00:05:40,610
it's sort of squish here see it kind of
makes a little line there way up at my

118
00:05:40,610 --> 00:05:40,620
makes a little line there way up at my
 

119
00:05:40,620 --> 00:05:43,010
makes a little line there way up at my
hand but I guess I got it up a water

00:05:53,830 --> 00:05:53,840
okay I guess I'm going to pause this for
 

125
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:55,210

it's a bit of a long way so yeah we're

286
00:11:59,710 --> 00:11:59,720
it's a bit of a long way so yeah we're
 

287
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:01,690
it's a bit of a long way so yeah we're
going to have to be patient until we get

288
00:12:01,690 --> 00:12:01,700
going to have to be patient until we get
 

289
00:12:01,700 --> 00:12:06,250
going to have to be patient until we get
there because it's pretty far away and I

290
00:12:06,250 --> 00:12:06,260
there because it's pretty far away and I
 

291
00:12:06,260 --> 00:12:08,380
there because it's pretty far away and I
guess in the meantime the sun's probably

292
00:12:08,380 --> 00:12:08,390
guess in the meantime the sun's probably
 

293
00:12:08,390 --> 00:12:11,770
guess in the meantime the sun's probably
going to rise because I mean it's 7 a.m.

294
00:12:11,770 --> 00:12:11,780
going to rise because I mean it's 7 a.m.
 

295
00:12:11,780 --> 00:12:14,410
going to rise because I mean it's 7 a.m.
look at this look at the sky at 7 a.m.

296
00:12:14,410 --> 00:12:14,420
look at this look at the sky at 7 a.m.
 

297
00:12:14,420 --> 00:12:18,440
look at this look at the sky at 7 a.m.
and it just feels like

298
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:18,450

 

299
00:12:18,450 --> 00:12:22,100

it feels like it's midnight I think

300
00:12:22,100 --> 00:12:22,110
it feels like it's midnight I think
 

301
00:12:22,110 --> 00:12:24,130
it feels like it's midnight I think
and it's something with the Earth's

302
00:12:24,130 --> 00:12:24,140
and it's something with the Earth's
 

303
00:12:24,140 --> 00:12:29,600
and it's something with the Earth's
rotation or something then somehow just

304
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:29,610
rotation or something then somehow just
 

305
00:12:29,610 --> 00:12:36,110
rotation or something then somehow just
makes it almost impossible to have any

306
00:12:36,110 --> 00:12:36,120
makes it almost impossible to have any
 

307
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:39,340
makes it almost impossible to have any
energy at all during the day like in

308
00:12:39,340 --> 00:12:39,350
energy at all during the day like in
 

309
00:12:39,350 --> 00:12:42,410
energy at all during the day like in
December and January and whatever

310
00:12:42,410 --> 00:12:42,420
December and January and whatever
 

311
00:12:42,420 --> 00:12:46,220
December and January and whatever
because they just barely have time to do

312
00:12:46,220 --> 00:12:46,230
because they just barely have time to do
 

313
00:12:46,230 --> 00:12:49,100
because they just barely have time to do
anything and then you know it's night

314
00:12:49,100 --> 00:12:49,110
anything and then you know it's night
 

315
00:12:49,110 --> 00:12:53,019
anything and then you know it's night
already you know

316
00:12:53,019 --> 00:12:53,029

 

317
00:12:53,029 --> 00:12:56,350

anyway

318
00:12:56,350 --> 00:12:56,360

 

319
00:12:56,360 --> 00:13:01,109

00:13:15,060 --> 00:13:15,070

 

327
00:13:15,070 --> 00:13:17,160

it's actually a little bit quicker than

328
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:17,170
it's actually a little bit quicker than
 

329
00:13:17,170 --> 00:13:19,290
it's actually a little bit quicker than
I thought since there's apparently

330
00:13:19,290 --> 00:13:19,300
I thought since there's apparently
 

331
00:13:19,300 --> 00:13:21,660
I thought since there's apparently
nobody's working today since it's

00:17:38,260 --> 00:17:41,760
place but there's a lot of stuff to do
first I mean I can't just sell the place

444
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:41,770
first I mean I can't just sell the place
 

445
00:17:41,770 --> 00:17:43,410

right now I mean they're going to sue my
 

447
00:17:43,420 --> 00:17:46,770

448
00:17:46,770 --> 00:17:46,780
ass if they find out or when they find
 

449
00:17:46,780 --> 00:17:48,900
ass if they find out or when they find
out that the bathroom is basically going

450
00:17:48,900 --> 00:17:48,910
out that the bathroom is basically going
 

451
00:17:48,910 --> 00:17:52,170
out that the bathroom is basically going
to be collapsing under their feet so

452
00:17:52,170 --> 00:17:52,180
to be collapsing under their feet so
 

453
00:17:52,180 --> 00:17:54,920
to be collapsing under their feet so
they're going to be suing my ass then

454

but anyway it just I think maybe if I do

456
00:18:04,410 --> 00:18:04,420
but anyway it just I think maybe if I do
 

457
00:18:04,420 --> 00:18:11,360
but anyway it just I think maybe if I do
some basic repairs I don't know I just

458
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:11,370
some basic repairs I don't know I just
 

459
00:18:11,370 --> 00:18:14,550
some basic repairs I don't know I just
you know maybe just clean it up a bit I

462
00:18:16,560 --> 00:18:16,570
know I've been saying this for like the
 

463
00:18:16,570 --> 00:18:23,340
know I've been saying this for like the
past ten years I guess but seriously if

464
00:18:23,340 --> 00:18:23,350
past ten years I guess but seriously if
 

465
00:18:23,350 --> 00:18:28,720
past ten years I guess but seriously if
I can clean it up a bit I mean

466
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:28,730

you know it's going to be like

468
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:34,330

 

469
00:18:34,330 --> 00:18:38,980

maybe at least I would be able to like

470
00:18:38,980 --> 00:18:38,990
maybe at least I would be able to like

just dry and I would count like sculpt
it in a nice shape and paint over it and
