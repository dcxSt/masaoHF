00:00:01,310 --> 00:00:04,640

well hello for anybody who's watching

2
00:00:04,640 --> 00:00:04,650
well hello for anybody who's watching
 

3
00:00:04,650 --> 00:00:10,720
well hello for anybody who's watching
this video I have a little exercise

4
00:00:10,720 --> 00:00:10,730
this video I have a little exercise
 

5
00:00:10,730 --> 00:00:15,680
this video I have a little exercise
philosophical exercise that I can

6
00:00:15,680 --> 00:00:15,690
philosophical exercise that I can
 

7
00:00:15,690 --> 00:00:19,820
philosophical exercise that I can
suggest and it's actually very powerful

8
00:00:19,820 --> 00:00:19,830
suggest and it's actually very powerful
 

9
00:00:19,830 --> 00:00:23,900
suggest and it's actually very powerful
and I call it basically reaching the

10
00:00:23,900 --> 00:00:23,910
and I call it basically reaching the
 

11
00:00:23,910 --> 00:00:27,410
and I call it basically reaching the
limits of knowledge reaching the limits

12
00:00:27,410 --> 00:00:27,420
limits of knowledge reaching the limits
 

13
00:00:27,420 --> 00:00:33,440
limits of knowledge reaching the limits
of the facade that you've built around

14
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:33,450
of the facade that you've built around
 

15
00:00:33,450 --> 00:00:36,470
of the facade that you've built around
the world that you inhabit what limits

16
00:00:36,470 --> 00:00:36,480
the world that you inhabit what limits
 

17
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:39,280
the world that you inhabit what limits
you in understanding will limits you in

18
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:39,290
you in understanding will limits you in
 

19
00:00:39,290 --> 00:00:45,770
you in understanding will limits you in
being able to to see to really see

20
00:00:45,770 --> 00:00:45,780
being able to to see to really see
 

21
00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:50,840
being able to to see to really see
something ok so the exercise is first of

22
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:50,850
something ok so the exercise is first of
 

23
00:00:50,850 --> 00:00:54,470
something ok so the exercise is first of
all you make a statement ok for example

24
00:00:54,470 --> 00:00:54,480
all you make a statement ok for example
 

25
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:59,119
all you make a statement ok for example
I can make the statement I today I went

26
00:00:59,119 --> 00:00:59,129
I can make the statement I today I went
 

27
00:00:59,129 --> 00:01:01,569
I can make the statement I today I went
to the post office ok that's a statement

28
00:01:01,569 --> 00:01:01,579
to the post office ok that's a statement
 

29
00:01:01,579 --> 00:01:04,160
to the post office ok that's a statement
and when you've made your statement you

30
00:01:04,160 --> 00:01:04,170
and when you've made your statement you
 

31
00:01:04,170 --> 00:01:08,450
and when you've made your statement you
ask yourself why ok so what is the

32
00:01:08,450 --> 00:01:08,460
ask yourself why ok so what is the
 

33
00:01:08,460 --> 00:01:12,460
ask yourself why ok so what is the
reason so I went to the post office why

34
00:01:12,460 --> 00:01:12,470
reason so I went to the post office why
 

35
00:01:12,470 --> 00:01:16,760
reason so I went to the post office why
because I wanted to mail a letter ok and

36
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:16,770
because I wanted to mail a letter ok and
 

37
00:01:16,770 --> 00:01:19,149
because I wanted to mail a letter ok and
then you can specify as much as you want

38
00:01:19,149 --> 00:01:19,159
then you can specify as much as you want
 

39
00:01:19,159 --> 00:01:22,450
then you can specify as much as you want
want to mail a letter to that person or

40
00:01:22,450 --> 00:01:22,460
want to mail a letter to that person or
 

41
00:01:22,460 --> 00:01:25,370
want to mail a letter to that person or
whatever now you've made the second

42
00:01:25,370 --> 00:01:25,380
whatever now you've made the second
 

43
00:01:25,380 --> 00:01:27,620
whatever now you've made the second
statement which is I wanted to mail a

44
00:01:27,620 --> 00:01:27,630
statement which is I wanted to mail a
 

45
00:01:27,630 --> 00:01:30,109
statement which is I wanted to mail a
letter and then you repeat the exercise

46
00:01:30,109 --> 00:01:30,119
letter and then you repeat the exercise
 

47
00:01:30,119 --> 00:01:33,140
letter and then you repeat the exercise
and you ask yourself why and then you

48
00:01:33,140 --> 00:01:33,150
and you ask yourself why and then you
 

49
00:01:33,150 --> 00:01:34,490
and you ask yourself why and then you
end up with a new statement and you keep

50
00:01:34,490 --> 00:01:34,500
end up with a new statement and you keep
 

51
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:36,530
end up with a new statement and you keep
going and you ask yourself why and you

52
00:01:36,530 --> 00:01:36,540
going and you ask yourself why and you
 

53
00:01:36,540 --> 00:01:38,390
going and you ask yourself why and you
end up on another statement and then you

54
00:01:38,390 --> 00:01:38,400
end up on another statement and then you
 

55
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:39,710
end up on another statement and then you
keep going and you can go on for hours

56
00:01:39,710 --> 00:01:39,720
keep going and you can go on for hours
 

57
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:45,289
keep going and you can go on for hours
and hours and hours and this is where

58
00:01:45,289 --> 00:01:45,299
and hours and hours and this is where
 

59
00:01:45,299 --> 00:01:47,870
and hours and hours and this is where
you really test yourself because at some

60
00:01:47,870 --> 00:01:47,880
you really test yourself because at some
 

61
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:52,039
you really test yourself because at some
point job when you find that you are

62
00:01:52,039 --> 00:01:52,049
point job when you find that you are
 

63
00:01:52,049 --> 00:01:55,670
point job when you find that you are
making a circular reasoning when you are

64
00:01:55,670 --> 00:01:55,680
making a circular reasoning when you are
 

65
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:59,060
making a circular reasoning when you are
answering for example well you have Y

66
00:01:59,060 --> 00:01:59,070
answering for example well you have Y
 

67
00:01:59,070 --> 00:02:00,859
answering for example well you have Y
and you answer well because that's the

68
00:02:00,859 --> 00:02:00,869
and you answer well because that's the
 

69
00:02:00,869 --> 00:02:03,050
and you answer well because that's the
way it is or when you find yourself

70
00:02:03,050 --> 00:02:03,060
way it is or when you find yourself
 

71
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:04,850
way it is or when you find yourself
dodging the question when you find

72
00:02:04,850 --> 00:02:04,860
dodging the question when you find
 

73
00:02:04,860 --> 00:02:07,039
dodging the question when you find
yourself well that you're not really

74
00:02:07,039 --> 00:02:07,049
yourself well that you're not really
 

75
00:02:07,049 --> 00:02:08,660
yourself well that you're not really
being honest that you're not really

76
00:02:08,660 --> 00:02:08,670
being honest that you're not really
 

77
00:02:08,670 --> 00:02:10,609
being honest that you're not really
trying to understand no you're not

78
00:02:10,609 --> 00:02:10,619
trying to understand no you're not
 

79
00:02:10,619 --> 00:02:13,560
trying to understand no you're not
really opening your mind

80
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:13,570
really opening your mind
 

81
00:02:13,570 --> 00:02:16,960
really opening your mind
eventually you'll stumble upon something

82
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:16,970
eventually you'll stumble upon something
 

83
00:02:16,970 --> 00:02:18,240
eventually you'll stumble upon something
like that so I'm kind of a block

84
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:18,250
like that so I'm kind of a block
 

85
00:02:18,250 --> 00:02:20,410
like that so I'm kind of a block
sometimes it's simply going to be I

86
00:02:20,410 --> 00:02:20,420
sometimes it's simply going to be I
 

87
00:02:20,420 --> 00:02:24,010
sometimes it's simply going to be I
don't know eventually though what you

88
00:02:24,010 --> 00:02:24,020
don't know eventually though what you
 

89
00:02:24,020 --> 00:02:27,160
don't know eventually though what you
have to do is to really look at what

90
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:27,170
have to do is to really look at what
 

91
00:02:27,170 --> 00:02:31,210
have to do is to really look at what
happened why can't you go on and really

92
00:02:31,210 --> 00:02:31,220
happened why can't you go on and really
 

93
00:02:31,220 --> 00:02:33,810
happened why can't you go on and really
try to open your mind and understand

94
00:02:33,810 --> 00:02:33,820
try to open your mind and understand
 

95
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:35,830
try to open your mind and understand
whether or not there's a way that you

96
00:02:35,830 --> 00:02:35,840
whether or not there's a way that you
 

97
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:38,340
whether or not there's a way that you
can actually keep going honestly and

98
00:02:38,340 --> 00:02:38,350
can actually keep going honestly and
 

99
00:02:38,350 --> 00:02:41,350
can actually keep going honestly and
when you stumble like that this is what

100
00:02:41,350 --> 00:02:41,360
when you stumble like that this is what
 

101
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:42,700
when you stumble like that this is what
I call the limit you've reached the

102
00:02:42,700 --> 00:02:42,710
I call the limit you've reached the
 

103
00:02:42,710 --> 00:02:46,650
I call the limit you've reached the
limit that's as far as you go and then

104
00:02:46,650 --> 00:02:46,660
limit that's as far as you go and then
 

105
00:02:46,660 --> 00:02:52,090
limit that's as far as you go and then
well you can see how we get all tangled

106
00:02:52,090 --> 00:02:52,100
well you can see how we get all tangled
 

107
00:02:52,100 --> 00:02:58,870
well you can see how we get all tangled
up in the logic in language basically we

108
00:02:58,870 --> 00:02:58,880
up in the logic in language basically we
 

109
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:04,660
up in the logic in language basically we
don't see reality what we see is our own

110
00:03:04,660 --> 00:03:04,670
don't see reality what we see is our own
 

111
00:03:04,670 --> 00:03:07,960
don't see reality what we see is our own
fabrication that comes as close as

112
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:07,970
fabrication that comes as close as
 

113
00:03:07,970 --> 00:03:12,240
fabrication that comes as close as
possible to what we believe is reality

114
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:12,250

 

115
00:03:12,250 --> 00:03:16,600

but that is simply an imitation and the

116
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:16,610
but that is simply an imitation and the
 

117
00:03:16,610 --> 00:03:18,730
but that is simply an imitation and the
objective is to try to see beyond that

118
00:03:18,730 --> 00:03:18,740
objective is to try to see beyond that
 

119
00:03:18,740 --> 00:03:23,110
objective is to try to see beyond that
and you know you can do this exercise

120
00:03:23,110 --> 00:03:23,120
and you know you can do this exercise
 

121
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:25,390
and you know you can do this exercise
for a long time you can spend the days

122
00:03:25,390 --> 00:03:25,400
for a long time you can spend the days
 

123
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:27,970
for a long time you can spend the days
and weeks you know you can write down

124
00:03:27,970 --> 00:03:27,980
and weeks you know you can write down
 

125
00:03:27,980 --> 00:03:31,570
and weeks you know you can write down
dollar your new statements on your

126
00:03:31,570 --> 00:03:31,580
dollar your new statements on your
 

127
00:03:31,580 --> 00:03:33,790
dollar your new statements on your
computer for example and every time you

128
00:03:33,790 --> 00:03:33,800
computer for example and every time you
 

129
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:35,530
computer for example and every time you
know you have your statement then you

130
00:03:35,530 --> 00:03:35,540
know you have your statement then you
 

131
00:03:35,540 --> 00:03:37,420
know you have your statement then you
write the next one and you know why and

132
00:03:37,420 --> 00:03:37,430
write the next one and you know why and
 

133
00:03:37,430 --> 00:03:39,670
write the next one and you know why and
then you just keep going and so we can

134
00:03:39,670 --> 00:03:39,680
then you just keep going and so we can
 

135
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:42,400
then you just keep going and so we can
trace your steps and see how far you go

136
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:42,410
trace your steps and see how far you go
 

137
00:03:42,410 --> 00:03:45,910
trace your steps and see how far you go
and eventually you can end up in some

138
00:03:45,910 --> 00:03:45,920
and eventually you can end up in some
 

139
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:51,550
and eventually you can end up in some
kind of weird biological babble about

140
00:03:51,550 --> 00:03:51,560
kind of weird biological babble about
 

141
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:54,010
kind of weird biological babble about
you know why does this person feel sad

142
00:03:54,010 --> 00:03:54,020
you know why does this person feel sad
 

143
00:03:54,020 --> 00:03:57,160
you know why does this person feel sad
and then you're you're he might start

144
00:03:57,160 --> 00:03:57,170
and then you're you're he might start
 

145
00:03:57,170 --> 00:04:01,810
and then you're you're he might start
talking about either holla that person's

146
00:04:01,810 --> 00:04:01,820
talking about either holla that person's
 

147
00:04:01,820 --> 00:04:05,530
talking about either holla that person's
brain works or you're going to start you

148
00:04:05,530 --> 00:04:05,540
brain works or you're going to start you
 

149
00:04:05,540 --> 00:04:07,690
brain works or you're going to start you
know digging into the past but you're

150
00:04:07,690 --> 00:04:07,700
know digging into the past but you're
 

151
00:04:07,700 --> 00:04:09,550
know digging into the past but you're
going to end up at some point you're

152
00:04:09,550 --> 00:04:09,560
going to end up at some point you're
 

153
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:10,810
going to end up at some point you're
going to stumble you're going to go in

154
00:04:10,810 --> 00:04:10,820
going to stumble you're going to go in
 

155
00:04:10,820 --> 00:04:15,760
going to stumble you're going to go in
circles you're going to just stop you're

156
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:15,770
circles you're going to just stop you're
 

157
00:04:15,770 --> 00:04:17,650
circles you're going to just stop you're
going to get blocked and the objective

158
00:04:17,650 --> 00:04:17,660
going to get blocked and the objective
 

159
00:04:17,660 --> 00:04:20,920
