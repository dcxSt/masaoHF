they could go dripped off a bit there

48
00:01:44,140 --> 00:01:44,150

 

49
00:01:44,150 --> 00:01:48,310

you're going crazy you kind of do things
 

55
00:02:02,450 --> 00:02:06,600
you're going crazy you kind of do things
like that wait a minute

56
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:06,610

 

57
00:02:06,610 --> 00:02:10,000

you know like I try different kind of

58
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:10,010
you know like I try different kind of
 

59
00:02:10,010 --> 00:02:14,950
you know like I try different kind of
combinations and I can't let it try this

60
00:02:14,950 --> 00:02:14,960
combinations and I can't let it try this
 

61
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:17,980
combinations and I can't let it try this
is like a mountain that I did there and

62
00:02:17,980 --> 00:02:17,990
is like a mountain that I did there and
 

63
00:02:17,990 --> 00:02:19,360
is like a mountain that I did there and
I think there's a staple hidden

64
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:19,370
I think there's a staple hidden
 

65
00:02:19,370 --> 00:02:23,070
I think there's a staple hidden
underneath it and I would put some eight

66
00:02:23,070 --> 00:02:23,080
underneath it and I would put some eight
 

67
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:28,600
underneath it and I would put some eight
and with liquid paper over it then have

68
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:28,610
and with liquid paper over it then have
 

69
00:02:28,610 --> 00:02:39,370
and with liquid paper over it then have
it mix and have it mixed with the liquid

70
00:02:39,370 --> 00:02:39,380
it mix and have it mixed with the liquid
 

71
00:02:39,380 --> 00:02:44,800
it mix and have it mixed with the liquid
paper and then like it would become like

72
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:44,810
paper and then like it would become like
 

73
00:02:44,810 --> 00:02:49,690
paper and then like it would become like
gray or whatever like an international

74
00:02:49,690 --> 00:02:49,700
gray or whatever like an international
 

75
00:02:49,700 --> 00:02:54,970
gray or whatever like an international
or interracial kind of liquid paper sort

76
00:02:54,970 --> 00:02:54,980
or interracial kind of liquid paper sort
 

77
00:02:54,980 --> 00:03:03,670
or interracial kind of liquid paper sort
of thingy there then I would do

78
00:03:03,670 --> 00:03:03,680
of thingy there then I would do
 

79
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:08,710
of thingy there then I would do
something like this and try to mix it up

80
00:03:08,710 --> 00:03:08,720
something like this and try to mix it up
 

81
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:14,530
something like this and try to mix it up
a bit now I like to do you know it's

82
00:03:14,530 --> 00:03:14,540
a bit now I like to do you know it's
 

83
00:03:14,540 --> 00:03:15,640
a bit now I like to do you know it's
like make these kind of weird

84
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:15,650
like make these kind of weird
 

85
00:03:15,650 --> 00:03:18,699
like make these kind of weird
combinations where one side is going to

86
00:03:18,699 --> 00:03:18,709
combinations where one side is going to
 

87
00:03:18,709 --> 00:03:22,440
combinations where one side is going to
dry up a different speed than the other

88
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:22,450
dry up a different speed than the other
 

89
00:03:22,450 --> 00:03:26,370
dry up a different speed than the other
and maybe put a little fortifications

90
00:03:26,370 --> 00:03:26,380
and maybe put a little fortifications
 

91
00:03:26,380 --> 00:03:30,630
and maybe put a little fortifications
around it there's something

92
00:03:30,630 --> 00:03:30,640

 

93
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:33,390

this thing isn't all that good it's a

94
00:03:33,390 --> 00:03:33,400
this thing isn't all that good it's a
 

95
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:37,730
this thing isn't all that good it's a
cheap brand from like balarama or

96
00:03:37,730 --> 00:03:37,740
cheap brand from like balarama or
 

97
00:03:37,740 --> 00:03:44,450
cheap brand from like balarama or
whatever how does this work

98
00:03:44,450 --> 00:03:44,460

 

99
00:03:44,460 --> 00:03:48,600

and then what I do is like I imagine

100
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:48,610
and then what I do is like I imagine
 

101
00:03:48,610 --> 00:03:50,760
and then what I do is like I imagine
there's like some kind of a bunch of

102
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:50,770
there's like some kind of a bunch of
 

103
00:03:50,770 --> 00:03:52,850
there's like some kind of a bunch of
people kind of stuck underneath there

104
00:03:52,850 --> 00:03:52,860
people kind of stuck underneath there
 

105
00:03:52,860 --> 00:03:56,520
people kind of stuck underneath there
like people so small this for them like

106
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:56,530
like people so small this for them like
 

107
00:03:56,530 --> 00:03:59,910
like people so small this for them like
one millimeter is the same as maybe a

108
00:03:59,910 --> 00:03:59,920
one millimeter is the same as maybe a
 

109
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:02,520
one millimeter is the same as maybe a
billion light years for us so they can

110
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:02,530
billion light years for us so they can
 

111
00:04:02,530 --> 00:04:06,900
billion light years for us so they can
fit like in the glow gaps there and then

112
00:04:06,900 --> 00:04:06,910
fit like in the glow gaps there and then
 

113
00:04:06,910 --> 00:04:09,150
fit like in the glow gaps there and then
I kind of like I don't want it to dry

114
00:04:09,150 --> 00:04:09,160
I kind of like I don't want it to dry
 

115
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:13,550
I kind of like I don't want it to dry
normally so I put it in the microwave or

116
00:04:13,550 --> 00:04:13,560
normally so I put it in the microwave or
 

117
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:17,160
normally so I put it in the microwave or
in the freezer and I leave them there

118
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:17,170
in the freezer and I leave them there
 

119
00:04:17,170 --> 00:04:20,370
in the freezer and I leave them there
like overnight or something and see like

120
00:04:20,370 --> 00:04:20,380
like overnight or something and see like
 

121
00:04:20,380 --> 00:04:24,150
like overnight or something and see like
how it's right up looks like to observe

122
00:04:24,150 --> 00:04:24,160
how it's right up looks like to observe
 

123
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:26,670
how it's right up looks like to observe
you know like the transformation or

124
00:04:26,670 --> 00:04:26,680
you know like the transformation or
 

125
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:28,560
you know like the transformation or
something so I guess I'll check this

126
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:28,570
something so I guess I'll check this
 

127
00:04:28,570 --> 00:04:34,560
something so I guess I'll check this
again tomorrow morning well it's been a

128
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:34,570
again tomorrow morning well it's been a
 

129
00:04:34,570 --> 00:04:38,460
again tomorrow morning well it's been a

149
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:51,750

I wonder because I I think here I left a

I wonder because I I think here I left a
 

151
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:54,930
I wonder because I I think here I left a
whole bunch of ink like this from the

152
00:05:54,930 --> 00:05:54,940
whole bunch of ink like this from the
 

153
00:05:54,940 --> 00:05:59,610
whole bunch of ink like this from the
bottle for about a week then I came back

154
00:05:59,610 --> 00:05:59,620
bottle for about a week then I came back
 

155
00:05:59,620 --> 00:06:02,250
bottle for about a week then I came back
and the the ink there was a huge blob of

156
00:06:02,250 --> 00:06:02,260
and the the ink there was a huge blob of
 

157
00:06:02,260 --> 00:06:05,280
and the the ink there was a huge blob of
ink it was all dry and they could touch

ink it was all dry and they could touch
 

159
00:06:05,290 --> 00:06:09,420
ink it was all dry and they could touch
it it was like hard as rock so I mean

160
00:06:09,420 --> 00:06:09,430
it it was like hard as rock so I mean
 

161
00:06:09,430 --> 00:06:11,040
it it was like hard as rock so I mean
you know like you could put liquid vapor

162
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:11,050
you know like you could put liquid vapor
 

163
00:06:11,050 --> 00:06:20,600
you know like you could put liquid vapor
on it or something and yeah so I guess I

164
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:20,610

 

165
00:06:20,610 --> 00:06:24,540

should try to cover these things up

166
00:06:24,540 --> 00:06:24,550
should try to cover these things up
 

167
00:06:24,550 --> 00:06:40,820
should try to cover these things up
there

168
00:06:40,820 --> 00:06:40,830

 

169
00:06:40,830 --> 00:06:46,710

it's frozen I don't think that would be

170
00:06:46,710 --> 00:06:46,720
it's frozen I don't think that would be
 

171
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:50,040
it's frozen I don't think that would be
good for our kitchen recipe but maybe

172
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:50,050
good for our kitchen recipe but maybe
 

173
00:06:50,050 --> 00:06:53,550
good for our kitchen recipe but maybe
the bleach would take out the water or

174
00:06:53,550 --> 00:06:53,560
the bleach would take out the water or
 

175
00:06:53,560 --> 00:07:02,700
the bleach would take out the water or
something of that ink yeah yeah this

176
00:07:02,700 --> 00:07:02,710
something of that ink yeah yeah this
 

177
00:07:02,710 --> 00:07:05,640
something of that ink yeah yeah this
would be like a whole frozen little bulb

178
00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:05,650
would be like a whole frozen little bulb
 

179
00:07:05,650 --> 00:07:11,270
would be like a whole frozen little bulb
here as well okay

180

here as well okay
 

181
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:13,950
here as well okay
we can see it starts to mix and it's

182
00:07:13,950 --> 00:07:13,960
we can see it starts to mix and it's
 

183
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:16,560
we can see it starts to mix and it's
getting kind of gray here this is kind

184
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:16,570
getting kind of gray here this is kind
 

185
00:07:16,570 --> 00:07:19,170
getting kind of gray here this is kind
of like white gorgeous color or whatever

186
00:07:19,170 --> 00:07:19,180

mixing it went better anyway so I won't
 

191
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:28,560
