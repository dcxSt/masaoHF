00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:19,970
know like they well not not even
 

179
00:08:19,970 --> 00:08:21,730
know like they well not not even
directly but they don't know that like

180
00:08:21,730 --> 00:08:21,740
directly but they don't know that like
 

181
00:08:21,740 --> 00:08:22,600
directly but they don't know that like
they're in a slaughterhouse

182
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:22,610
they're in a slaughterhouse

00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:34,250
every night or something and so they
 

191
00:08:34,250 --> 00:08:36,400
every night or something and so they
they just assume that that's the way

192
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:36,410
they just assume that that's the way
 

193

00:10:52,130 --> 00:10:52,140
previous machine some of the older
 

265
00:10:52,140 --> 00:10:55,160
previous machine some of the older
videos you see like when had the brown

266
00:10:55,160 --> 00:10:55,170
videos you see like when had the brown

269
00:10:59,520 --> 00:11:01,700
thing and when I removed the brown thing
because it was really old I mean I

270
00:11:01,700 --> 00:11:01,710
because it was really old I mean I
 

271
00:11:01,710 --> 00:11:06,260
because it was really old I mean I
noticed it you know up there well it's

272
00:11:06,260 --> 00:11:06,270
noticed it you know up there well it's
 

273
00:11:06,270 --> 00:11:08,270
noticed it you know up there well it's
uh it's wood

274
00:11:08,270 --> 00:11:08,280
uh it's wood
 

275
00:11:08,280 --> 00:11:15,290
uh it's wood
see there's no hole it's not I mean the

276
00:11:15,290 --> 00:11:15,300
see there's no hole it's not I mean the
 

277
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:17,660
see there's no hole it's not I mean the
DES fan here isn't sending the air and

278
00:11:17,660 --> 00:11:17,670
DES fan here isn't sending the air and
 

279
00:11:17,670 --> 00:11:21,170
DES fan here isn't sending the air and
some kind of like hole in the wall or

280
00:11:21,170 --> 00:11:21,180
some kind of like hole in the wall or
 

281
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:23,450
some kind of like hole in the wall or
something that goes outside to ventilate

282
00:11:23,450 --> 00:11:23,460
something that goes outside to ventilate
 

283
00:11:23,460 --> 00:11:28,100
something that goes outside to ventilate
the place it's blowing the air right on

284
00:11:28,100 --> 00:11:28,110
the place it's blowing the air right on
 

285
00:11:28,110 --> 00:11:30,620
the place it's blowing the air right on
this thing so I mean it makes no sense

286
00:11:30,620 --> 00:11:30,630
this thing so I mean it makes no sense
 

287
00:11:30,630 --> 00:11:33,470
this thing so I mean it makes no sense
it kind of looks like you know it anyway

288
00:11:33,470 --> 00:11:33,480
it kind of looks like you know it anyway
 

289
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:37,690
it kind of looks like you know it anyway
so I put this one instead but it really

290
00:11:37,690 --> 00:11:37,700
so I put this one instead but it really
 

291
00:11:37,700 --> 00:11:41,060
so I put this one instead but it really
serves ups with no purpose I mean it you

292
00:11:41,060 --> 00:11:41,070
serves ups with no purpose I mean it you
 

293
00:11:41,070 --> 00:11:42,860
serves ups with no purpose I mean it you
know the error just hits the wood and

294
00:11:42,860 --> 00:11:42,870
know the error just hits the wood and
 

295
00:11:42,870 --> 00:11:47,210
know the error just hits the wood and
comes back out it completely it makes

296
00:11:47,210 --> 00:11:47,220
comes back out it completely it makes
 

297
00:11:47,220 --> 00:11:48,740
comes back out it completely it makes
absolutely no sense actually to have

298
00:11:48,740 --> 00:11:48,750
absolutely no sense actually to have
 

299
00:11:48,750 --> 00:11:57,309
absolutely no sense actually to have
that but anyway so

300
00:11:57,309 --> 00:11:57,319
that but anyway so
 

301
00:11:57,319 --> 00:12:11,809
that but anyway so
