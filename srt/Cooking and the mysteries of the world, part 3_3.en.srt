without ever reaching it and the more
 

3
00:00:04,650 --> 00:00:08,600
without ever reaching it and the more
you drift away the more you think in

4
00:00:08,600 --> 00:00:08,610
you drift away the more you think in
 

5
00:00:08,610 --> 00:00:12,499
you drift away the more you think in
some other terms and you can ever

6
00:00:12,499 --> 00:00:12,509
some other terms and you can ever
 

7
00:00:12,509 --> 00:00:16,220
some other terms and you can ever
explain what world be is because you can

8
00:00:16,220 --> 00:00:16,230
explain what world be is because you can
 

9
00:00:16,230 --> 00:00:19,099
explain what world be is because you can
only see it from the lenses of the

10
00:00:19,099 --> 00:00:19,109
only see it from the lenses of the
 

11
00:00:19,109 --> 00:00:23,330
only see it from the lenses of the
brainwashing of world eh and if you can

12
00:00:23,330 --> 00:00:23,340
brainwashing of world eh and if you can
 

13
00:00:23,340 --> 00:00:26,150
brainwashing of world eh and if you can
see it better than most people you can't

14
00:00:26,150 --> 00:00:26,160
see it better than most people you can't
 

15
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:29,179
see it better than most people you can't
communicate it because it's like a

16
00:00:29,179 --> 00:00:29,189
communicate it because it's like a
 

17
00:00:29,189 --> 00:00:36,910
communicate it because it's like a
satellite television satellite

18
00:00:36,910 --> 00:00:36,920
satellite television satellite
 

19
00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:40,030
satellite television satellite
television they don't communicate

20
00:00:40,030 --> 00:00:40,040
television they don't communicate
 

21
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:44,450
television they don't communicate
directly they go through the

22
00:00:44,450 --> 00:00:44,460
directly they go through the
 

23
00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:47,750
directly they go through the
intermediary of the satellite and world

24
00:00:47,750 --> 00:00:47,760
intermediary of the satellite and world
 

25
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:53,060
intermediary of the satellite and world
a is like an intermediary that prevents

26
00:00:53,060 --> 00:00:53,070
a is like an intermediary that prevents
 

27
00:00:53,070 --> 00:00:55,910
a is like an intermediary that prevents
us from entering the other world but in

28
00:00:55,910 --> 00:00:55,920
us from entering the other world but in
 

29
00:00:55,920 --> 00:01:08,570
us from entering the other world but in
this world 1 equals 1 point 0 000000 all

30
00:01:08,570 --> 00:01:08,580
this world 1 equals 1 point 0 000000 all
 

31
00:01:08,580 --> 00:01:15,380
this world 1 equals 1 point 0 000000 all
the way to infinity so now let's take a

32
00:01:15,380 --> 00:01:15,390
the way to infinity so now let's take a
 

33
00:01:15,390 --> 00:01:20,149
the way to infinity so now let's take a
little bit of an example you have these

34
00:01:20,149 --> 00:01:20,159
little bit of an example you have these
 

35
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:26,899
little bit of an example you have these
two tomatoes what if I take this ok and

36
00:01:26,899 --> 00:01:26,909
two tomatoes what if I take this ok and
 

37
00:01:26,909 --> 00:01:36,410
two tomatoes what if I take this ok and
I cut out a little portion how do you do

38
00:01:36,410 --> 00:01:36,420
I cut out a little portion how do you do
 

39
00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:41,120
I cut out a little portion how do you do
that on the tomato

40
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:41,130

 

41
00:01:41,130 --> 00:01:53,510

even it up yeah okay now what do we have

42
00:01:53,510 --> 00:01:53,520
even it up yeah okay now what do we have
 

43
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:58,069
even it up yeah okay now what do we have
here is this a tomato yeah it's a tomato

44
00:01:58,069 --> 00:01:58,079
here is this a tomato yeah it's a tomato
 

45
00:01:58,079 --> 00:02:01,999
here is this a tomato yeah it's a tomato
is this a tomato yeah it's a tomato so

46
00:02:01,999 --> 00:02:02,009
is this a tomato yeah it's a tomato so
 

47
00:02:02,009 --> 00:02:05,350
is this a tomato yeah it's a tomato so
we have two tomatoes this is true here

48
00:02:05,350 --> 00:02:05,360
we have two tomatoes this is true here
 

49
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:10,910
we have two tomatoes this is true here
but here it can't be either true nor

50
00:02:10,910 --> 00:02:10,920
but here it can't be either true nor
 

51
00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:19,839
but here it can't be either true nor
false because this number is not real

52
00:02:19,839 --> 00:02:19,849
false because this number is not real
 

53
00:02:19,849 --> 00:02:24,949
false because this number is not real
what it is it's a symbol a symbol is a

54
00:02:24,949 --> 00:02:24,959
what it is it's a symbol a symbol is a
 

55
00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:31,660
what it is it's a symbol a symbol is a
tool a symbol is something that we use

56
00:02:31,660 --> 00:02:31,670
tool a symbol is something that we use
 

57
00:02:31,670 --> 00:02:37,360
tool a symbol is something that we use
to orient ourselves and to communicate

58
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:37,370
to orient ourselves and to communicate
 

59
00:02:37,370 --> 00:02:41,960
to orient ourselves and to communicate
so when I cut this little thing here

60
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:41,970
so when I cut this little thing here
 

61
00:02:41,970 --> 00:02:47,059
so when I cut this little thing here
what you have this is not zero point

62
00:02:47,059 --> 00:02:47,069
what you have this is not zero point
 

63
00:02:47,069 --> 00:02:50,569
what you have this is not zero point
nine nine nine eight percent of a tomato

64
00:02:50,569 --> 00:02:50,579
nine nine nine eight percent of a tomato
 

65
00:02:50,579 --> 00:02:54,710
nine nine nine eight percent of a tomato
or rather nine ninety eight percent or

66
00:02:54,710 --> 00:02:54,720
or rather nine ninety eight percent or
 

67
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:56,420
or rather nine ninety eight percent or
rather ninety-nine point nine eight

68
00:02:56,420 --> 00:02:56,430
rather ninety-nine point nine eight
 

69
00:02:56,430 --> 00:03:00,199
rather ninety-nine point nine eight
whatever if you want to be anal about it

70
00:03:00,199 --> 00:03:00,209
whatever if you want to be anal about it
 

71
00:03:00,209 --> 00:03:02,599
whatever if you want to be anal about it
this is not you know a percentage of a

72
00:03:02,599 --> 00:03:02,609
this is not you know a percentage of a
 

73
00:03:02,609 --> 00:03:05,539
this is not you know a percentage of a
tomato just because we took a part away

74
00:03:05,539 --> 00:03:05,549
tomato just because we took a part away
 

75
00:03:05,549 --> 00:03:09,440
tomato just because we took a part away
from it okay if one is the tomato this

76
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:09,450
from it okay if one is the tomato this
 

77
00:03:09,450 --> 00:03:12,800
from it okay if one is the tomato this
is not 0.9 whatever that's not what this

78
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:12,810
is not 0.9 whatever that's not what this
 

79
00:03:12,810 --> 00:03:17,120
is not 0.9 whatever that's not what this
is this is a tomato it's still one but

80
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:17,130
is this is a tomato it's still one but
 

81
00:03:17,130 --> 00:03:19,460
is this is a tomato it's still one but
it's one here because when we're

82
00:03:19,460 --> 00:03:19,470
it's one here because when we're
 

83
00:03:19,470 --> 00:03:24,800
it's one here because when we're
counting is not the mass it's not the

84
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:24,810
counting is not the mass it's not the
 

85
00:03:24,810 --> 00:03:28,360
counting is not the mass it's not the
reality we are not counting the

86
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:28,370
reality we are not counting the
 

87
00:03:28,370 --> 00:03:32,240
reality we are not counting the
accumulation of the neutrons and

88
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:32,250
accumulation of the neutrons and
 

89
00:03:32,250 --> 00:03:35,809
accumulation of the neutrons and
electrons but the billions and billions

90
00:03:35,809 --> 00:03:35,819
electrons but the billions and billions
 

91
00:03:35,819 --> 00:03:38,240
electrons but the billions and billions
of them that have come together to form

92
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:38,250
of them that have come together to form
 

93
00:03:38,250 --> 00:03:41,120
of them that have come together to form
the shape that's not what we're counting

94
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:41,130
the shape that's not what we're counting
 

95
00:03:41,130 --> 00:03:44,240
the shape that's not what we're counting
because no two tomatoes are exactly the

96
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:44,250
because no two tomatoes are exactly the
 

97
00:03:44,250 --> 00:03:47,180
because no two tomatoes are exactly the
same weight no two tomatoes have exactly

98
00:03:47,180 --> 00:03:47,190
same weight no two tomatoes have exactly
 

99
00:03:47,190 --> 00:03:50,990
same weight no two tomatoes have exactly
the same composition so this number is

100
00:03:50,990 --> 00:03:51,000
the same composition so this number is
 

101
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,990
the same composition so this number is
not real when it comes to county

102
00:03:53,990 --> 00:03:54,000
not real when it comes to county
 

103
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:58,130
not real when it comes to county
tomatoes what we're actually counting is

104
00:03:58,130 --> 00:03:58,140
tomatoes what we're actually counting is
 

105
00:03:58,140 --> 00:04:00,670
tomatoes what we're actually counting is
not something that exists outside of us

106
00:04:00,670 --> 00:04:00,680
not something that exists outside of us
 

107
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:03,470
not something that exists outside of us
we're counting something that exists

108
00:04:03,470 --> 00:04:03,480
we're counting something that exists
 

109
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:08,780
we're counting something that exists
within us we're counting cymbals and the

110
00:04:08,780 --> 00:04:08,790
within us we're counting cymbals and the
 

111
00:04:08,790 --> 00:04:13,850
within us we're counting cymbals and the
word tomato is a symbol the definition

112
00:04:13,850 --> 00:04:13,860
word tomato is a symbol the definition
 

113
00:04:13,860 --> 00:04:17,150
word tomato is a symbol the definition
of tomato in a dictionary is a symbol

114
00:04:17,150 --> 00:04:17,160
of tomato in a dictionary is a symbol
 

115
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:24,100
of tomato in a dictionary is a symbol
and when we see this we see a layer of

116
00:04:24,100 --> 00:04:24,110
and when we see this we see a layer of
 

117
00:04:24,110 --> 00:04:27,730
and when we see this we see a layer of
existence from a certain vantage point

118
00:04:27,730 --> 00:04:27,740
existence from a certain vantage point
 

119
00:04:27,740 --> 00:04:35,560
existence from a certain vantage point
and that vantage point is something that

120
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:35,570
and that vantage point is something that
 

121
00:04:35,570 --> 00:04:39,710
and that vantage point is something that
cannot that doesn't have any meaning by

122
00:04:39,710 --> 00:04:39,720
cannot that doesn't have any meaning by
 

123
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:42,890
cannot that doesn't have any meaning by
itself it's like binary code it only has

124
00:04:42,890 --> 00:04:42,900
itself it's like binary code it only has
 

125
00:04:42,900 --> 00:04:44,870
itself it's like binary code it only has
meaning when it's interpreted by a

126
00:04:44,870 --> 00:04:44,880
meaning when it's interpreted by a
 

127
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:48,860
meaning when it's interpreted by a
machine okay and that machine is our

128
00:04:48,860 --> 00:04:48,870
machine okay and that machine is our
 

129
00:04:48,870 --> 00:04:52,820
machine okay and that machine is our
brain we get this information from our

130
00:04:52,820 --> 00:04:52,830
brain we get this information from our
 

131
00:04:52,830 --> 00:04:57,380
brain we get this information from our
eyes of the shape we see and our brain

132
00:04:57,380 --> 00:04:57,390
eyes of the shape we see and our brain
 

133
00:04:57,390 --> 00:05:01,130
eyes of the shape we see and our brain
puts it back together and forms an image

134
00:05:01,130 --> 00:05:01,140
puts it back together and forms an image
 

135
00:05:01,140 --> 00:05:03,800
puts it back together and forms an image
that appears in vivid color in our

136
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:03,810
that appears in vivid color in our
 

137
00:05:03,810 --> 00:05:07,719
that appears in vivid color in our
consciousness and we remember all our

138
00:05:07,719 --> 00:05:07,729
consciousness and we remember all our
 

139
00:05:07,729 --> 00:05:11,270
consciousness and we remember all our
experiences in life we remember seeing

140
00:05:11,270 --> 00:05:11,280
experiences in life we remember seeing
 

141
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:15,560
experiences in life we remember seeing
something just like that or very similar

142
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:15,570
something just like that or very similar
 

143
00:05:15,570 --> 00:05:20,090
something just like that or very similar
to it that has the same texture a smell

144
00:05:20,090 --> 00:05:20,100
to it that has the same texture a smell
 

145
00:05:20,100 --> 00:05:24,230
to it that has the same texture a smell
and the feel and we've seen other people

146
00:05:24,230 --> 00:05:24,240
and the feel and we've seen other people
 

147
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:27,380
and the feel and we've seen other people
heard other people call this a tomato

148
00:05:27,380 --> 00:05:27,390
heard other people call this a tomato
 

149
00:05:27,390 --> 00:05:31,010
heard other people call this a tomato
and a tomato is the concept that exists

150
00:05:31,010 --> 00:05:31,020
and a tomato is the concept that exists
 

151
00:05:31,020 --> 00:05:34,330
and a tomato is the concept that exists
in our minds that dilemma nates

152
00:05:34,330 --> 00:05:34,340
in our minds that dilemma nates
 

153
00:05:34,340 --> 00:05:36,620
in our minds that dilemma nates
artificially the reality we see around

154
00:05:36,620 --> 00:05:36,630
artificially the reality we see around
 

155
00:05:36,630 --> 00:05:41,480
artificially the reality we see around
us and so a tomato inside of us is a

156
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:41,490
us and so a tomato inside of us is a
 

157
00:05:41,490 --> 00:05:46,130
us and so a tomato inside of us is a
concept that we use to cut all around

158
00:05:46,130 --> 00:05:46,140
concept that we use to cut all around
 

159
00:05:46,140 --> 00:05:49,640
concept that we use to cut all around

this and separate it from the floor and
 

161
00:05:49,650 --> 00:05:55,400
this and separate it from the floor and
the air around it and makes it into an

the air around it and makes it into an
 

163
00:05:55,410 --> 00:05:58,490
the air around it and makes it into an
entity of its own and there is one

00:05:58,490 --> 00:05:58,500
entity of its own and there is one
 

165
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:03,469
entity of its own and there is one
concept here of a tomato who the one is

166
00:06:03,469 --> 00:06:03,479
concept here of a tomato who the one is
 

167
00:06:03,479 --> 00:06:05,610
concept here of a tomato who the one is
the concept

168
00:06:05,610 --> 00:06:05,620
the concept
 

169
00:06:05,620 --> 00:06:09,780
the concept
in our brain one concept in our brain of

170
00:06:09,780 --> 00:06:09,790
in our brain one concept in our brain of
 

171
00:06:09,790 --> 00:06:13,110
in our brain one concept in our brain of
tomato plus one concept in our brain of

tomato plus one concept in our brain of
 

173
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:18,150
tomato plus one concept in our brain of
tomato equals two concepts in our brain

174
00:06:18,150 --> 00:06:18,160
tomato equals two concepts in our brain
 

175
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:22,140
tomato equals two concepts in our brain
of tomatoes that is the world we live in

176
00:06:22,140 --> 00:06:22,150
of tomatoes that is the world we live in
 

177
00:06:22,150 --> 00:06:30,540
of tomatoes that is the world we live in
in the world be in the other world this

178
00:06:30,540 --> 00:06:30,550
in the world be in the other world this
 

179
00:06:30,550 --> 00:06:36,750
in the world be in the other world this
is nothing but matter that is taking

180
00:06:36,750 --> 00:06:36,760
is nothing but matter that is taking
 

181
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:41,430
is nothing but matter that is taking
forms and moving around like a swarm of

182
00:06:41,430 --> 00:06:41,440
forms and moving around like a swarm of
 

183
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:46,409
forms and moving around like a swarm of
bees can all the bees are moving around

184
00:06:46,409 --> 00:06:46,419
bees can all the bees are moving around
 

185
00:06:46,419 --> 00:06:52,040
bees can all the bees are moving around
all of a sudden the bees form a circle

186
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:52,050
all of a sudden the bees form a circle
 

187
00:06:52,050 --> 00:06:58,620
all of a sudden the bees form a circle
and you see this a circle exists does it

188
00:06:58,620 --> 00:06:58,630
and you see this a circle exists does it
 

189
00:06:58,630 --> 00:07:02,189
and you see this a circle exists does it
really while you see a circle but soon

190
00:07:02,189 --> 00:07:02,199
really while you see a circle but soon
 

191
00:07:02,199 --> 00:07:05,850
really while you see a circle but soon
after a few seconds later all the bees

192
00:07:05,850 --> 00:07:05,860
after a few seconds later all the bees
 

193
00:07:05,860 --> 00:07:08,430
after a few seconds later all the bees
move in a different direction there is

194
00:07:08,430 --> 00:07:08,440
move in a different direction there is
 

195
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:10,980
move in a different direction there is
no longer any circle but all the

196
00:07:10,980 --> 00:07:10,990
no longer any circle but all the
 

197
00:07:10,990 --> 00:07:12,690
no longer any circle but all the
physical matter that composed that

198
00:07:12,690 --> 00:07:12,700
physical matter that composed that
 

199
00:07:12,700 --> 00:07:16,670
physical matter that composed that
circle still exists just change shape

200
00:07:16,670 --> 00:07:16,680
circle still exists just change shape
 

201
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:19,469
circle still exists just change shape
this is just an accumulation of matter

202
00:07:19,469 --> 00:07:19,479
this is just an accumulation of matter
 

203
00:07:19,479 --> 00:07:23,520
this is just an accumulation of matter
and the word tomato does not have any

204
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:23,530
and the word tomato does not have any
 

205
00:07:23,530 --> 00:07:27,629
and the word tomato does not have any
existence it is in our mind that is why

206
00:07:27,629 --> 00:07:27,639
existence it is in our mind that is why
 

207
00:07:27,639 --> 00:07:32,850
existence it is in our mind that is why
in one world it is true that one tomato

208
00:07:32,850 --> 00:07:32,860
in one world it is true that one tomato
 

209
00:07:32,860 --> 00:07:35,219
in one world it is true that one tomato
plus one tomato equals two tomatoes we

210
00:07:35,219 --> 00:07:35,229
plus one tomato equals two tomatoes we
 

211
00:07:35,229 --> 00:07:37,710
plus one tomato equals two tomatoes we
have two tomatoes and it's true it's not

212
00:07:37,710 --> 00:07:37,720
have two tomatoes and it's true it's not
 

213
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:41,370
have two tomatoes and it's true it's not
false it's true in this world and in

214
00:07:41,370 --> 00:07:41,380
false it's true in this world and in
 

215
00:07:41,380 --> 00:07:43,430
false it's true in this world and in
this world is neither true nor false

216
00:07:43,430 --> 00:07:43,440
this world is neither true nor false
 

217
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:47,219
this world is neither true nor false
because in this world truth is not what

218
00:07:47,219 --> 00:07:47,229
because in this world truth is not what
 

219
00:07:47,229 --> 00:07:49,219
because in this world truth is not what
it is in the other world in this world

220
00:07:49,219 --> 00:07:49,229
it is in the other world in this world
 

221
00:07:49,229 --> 00:07:51,750
it is in the other world in this world
truth again is just a tool of

222
00:07:51,750 --> 00:07:51,760
truth again is just a tool of
 

223
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:55,230
truth again is just a tool of
communication it's just something we

224
00:07:55,230 --> 00:07:55,240
communication it's just something we
 

225
00:07:55,240 --> 00:08:01,680
communication it's just something we
used to facilitate our lives and so

226
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:01,690
used to facilitate our lives and so
 

227
00:08:01,690 --> 00:08:07,529
used to facilitate our lives and so
that's why people get brainwashed but

228
00:08:07,529 --> 00:08:07,539
that's why people get brainwashed but
 

229
00:08:07,539 --> 00:08:09,629
that's why people get brainwashed but
the brainwashing is not necessarily bad

230
00:08:09,629 --> 00:08:09,639
the brainwashing is not necessarily bad
 

231
00:08:09,639 --> 00:08:13,110
the brainwashing is not necessarily bad
because if we weren't brainwashed we

232
00:08:13,110 --> 00:08:13,120
because if we weren't brainwashed we
 

233
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:16,740
because if we weren't brainwashed we
couldn't survive we have to be

234
00:08:16,740 --> 00:08:16,750
couldn't survive we have to be
 

235
00:08:16,750 --> 00:08:19,570
couldn't survive we have to be
but just because we have to be doesn't

236
00:08:19,570 --> 00:08:19,580
but just because we have to be doesn't
 

237
00:08:19,580 --> 00:08:23,230
but just because we have to be doesn't
mean we can't acknowledge that we are we

238
00:08:23,230 --> 00:08:23,240
mean we can't acknowledge that we are we
 

239
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:25,900
mean we can't acknowledge that we are we
have created an artificial world the

240
00:08:25,900 --> 00:08:25,910
have created an artificial world the
 

241
00:08:25,910 --> 00:08:27,550
have created an artificial world the
world of our point of view of our

242
00:08:27,550 --> 00:08:27,560
world of our point of view of our
 

243
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:31,090
world of our point of view of our
consciousness that we use for our own

244
00:08:31,090 --> 00:08:31,100
consciousness that we use for our own
 

245
00:08:31,100 --> 00:08:35,680
consciousness that we use for our own
benefit and that's what happens when

246
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:35,690
benefit and that's what happens when
 

247
00:08:35,690 --> 00:08:40,180
benefit and that's what happens when
people get confused between the two they

248
00:08:40,180 --> 00:08:40,190
people get confused between the two they
 

249
00:08:40,190 --> 00:08:43,720
people get confused between the two they
don't know what's real anymore it's like

250
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:43,730
don't know what's real anymore it's like
 

251
00:08:43,730 --> 00:08:48,130
don't know what's real anymore it's like
when you ask what does God exist well

252
00:08:48,130 --> 00:08:48,140
when you ask what does God exist well
 

253
00:08:48,140 --> 00:08:51,090
when you ask what does God exist well
there's one world and there is the other

254
00:08:51,090 --> 00:08:51,100
there's one world and there is the other
 

255
00:08:51,100 --> 00:08:54,430
there's one world and there is the other
what does existing means does this

256
00:08:54,430 --> 00:08:54,440
what does existing means does this
 

257
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:58,570
what does existing means does this
circle exist even though a few seconds

258
00:08:58,570 --> 00:08:58,580
circle exist even though a few seconds
 

259
00:08:58,580 --> 00:09:00,700
circle exist even though a few seconds
later the beanies are in a different

260
00:09:00,700 --> 00:09:00,710
later the beanies are in a different
 

261
00:09:00,710 --> 00:09:07,300
later the beanies are in a different
position do I exist am I just a physical

262
00:09:07,300 --> 00:09:07,310
position do I exist am I just a physical
 

263
00:09:07,310 --> 00:09:11,560
position do I exist am I just a physical
matter that composes me am I just the

264
00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:11,570
matter that composes me am I just the
 

265
00:09:11,570 --> 00:09:13,930
matter that composes me am I just the
idea of myself that exists in the minds

idea of myself that exists in the minds
 

267
00:09:13,940 --> 00:09:17,350
idea of myself that exists in the minds
of people and the footsteps that I have

00:09:17,350 --> 00:09:17,360
of people and the footsteps that I have
 

269
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:22,210
of people and the footsteps that I have
left in the desert of life what if white

00:09:22,210 --> 00:09:22,220
left in the desert of life what if white
 

271
00:09:22,220 --> 00:09:25,510
left in the desert of life what if white
all fades away do I still exist we can't

272
00:09:25,510 --> 00:09:25,520
all fades away do I still exist we can't
 

273
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:26,890
all fades away do I still exist we can't
answer that if you don't know what the

274
00:09:26,890 --> 00:09:26,900
answer that if you don't know what the
 

275
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:29,950
answer that if you don't know what the
word needs and it's just a word it means

276
00:09:29,950 --> 00:09:29,960
word needs and it's just a word it means

word needs and it's just a word it means
whatever we want it to mean language is

00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:34,130
whatever we want it to mean language is
 

279
00:09:34,130 --> 00:09:36,150
whatever we want it to mean language is
not the slave of dictionaries

280
00:09:36,150 --> 00:09:36,160
not the slave of dictionaries
 

281
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:38,440
not the slave of dictionaries
dictionaries is a slave of language and

282
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:38,450
dictionaries is a slave of language and
 

283
00:09:38,450 --> 00:09:40,690
dictionaries is a slave of language and
languages are asleep because we built it

284
00:09:40,690 --> 00:09:40,700
languages are asleep because we built it
 

285
00:09:40,700 --> 00:09:44,920
languages are asleep because we built it
it's ours and that's why we're

286
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:44,930
it's ours and that's why we're
 

287
00:09:44,930 --> 00:09:49,150
it's ours and that's why we're
brainwashed and I think that I'm getting

288
00:09:49,150 --> 00:09:49,160
brainwashed and I think that I'm getting
 

289
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:51,550
brainwashed and I think that I'm getting
car so I'm going to drink the coffee or
