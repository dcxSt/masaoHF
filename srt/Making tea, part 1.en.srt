innovating you know we've got all these

94
00:02:44,509 --> 00:02:44,519
innovating you know we've got all these
 

95

98
00:02:49,610 --> 00:02:49,620
today and I mean think about apples
 

99
00:02:49,620 --> 00:02:52,429
today and I mean think about apples
hopefully when you're eating apples I

100
00:02:52,429 --> 00:02:52,439
hopefully when you're eating apples I
 

101
00:02:52,439 --> 00:02:55,490
hopefully when you're eating apples I
mean essentially eating an apple is

102
00:02:55,490 --> 00:02:55,500
mean essentially eating an apple is
 

103
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:57,830
mean essentially eating an apple is
basically the same thing you know

104
00:02:57,830 --> 00:02:57,840
basically the same thing you know
 

105
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:01,759
basically the same thing you know
because you know the Apple falls on the

106
00:03:01,759 --> 00:03:01,769
because you know the Apple falls on the
 

107
00:03:01,769 --> 00:03:03,920
because you know the Apple falls on the
soil or something and then it got

108
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:03,930
soil or something and then it got
 

109
00:03:03,930 --> 00:03:06,470
soil or something and then it got
another tree that can't grows from that

110
00:03:06,470 --> 00:03:06,480
another tree that can't grows from that
 

111
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:08,240
another tree that can't grows from that
Apple right so the Apple is essentially

112
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:08,250
Apple right so the Apple is essentially
 

113
00:03:08,250 --> 00:03:10,550
Apple right so the Apple is essentially
the same thing as you know when you have

114
00:03:10,550 --> 00:03:10,560
the same thing as you know when you have
 

115
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:13,729
the same thing as you know when you have
a tree whose jacking up or something and

116
00:03:13,729 --> 00:03:13,739
a tree whose jacking up or something and
 

117
00:03:13,739 --> 00:03:16,399
a tree whose jacking up or something and
you're like you know giving it some

118
00:03:16,399 --> 00:03:16,409
you're like you know giving it some
 

119
00:03:16,409 --> 00:03:18,439
you're like you know giving it some
default because that's what happens when

120
00:03:18,439 --> 00:03:18,449
default because that's what happens when
 

121
00:03:18,449 --> 00:03:19,550
default because that's what happens when
you're eating an apple right you're

124
00:03:23,119 --> 00:03:23,129
giving it a tree of a blow job because
 

125
00:03:23,129 --> 00:03:26,089

you know the Apple is that the seed from
the tree right so I mean you know today

128
00:03:30,259 --> 00:03:30,269
the tree right so I mean you know today
 

129
00:03:30,269 --> 00:03:32,330
the tree right so I mean you know today
you've got people who you know the

130
00:03:32,330 --> 00:03:32,340
