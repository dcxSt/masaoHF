I'm sure that what the best thing is I

44
00:01:44,300 --> 00:01:44,310
I'm sure that what the best thing is I
 

45
00:01:44,310 --> 00:01:49,039
I'm sure that what the best thing is I
could maybe if I like a metal pipe or

46
00:01:49,039 --> 00:01:49,049
could maybe if I like a metal pipe or
 

47
00:01:49,049 --> 00:01:51,800
could maybe if I like a metal pipe or
something and I just like put it down

48
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:51,810
something and I just like put it down
 

49
00:01:51,810 --> 00:01:55,100
something and I just like put it down
here well it's not going to hold very

50
00:01:55,100 --> 00:01:55,110
here well it's not going to hold very
 

51
00:01:55,110 --> 00:01:59,300
here well it's not going to hold very
well but and I can because I have to put

52
00:01:59,300 --> 00:01:59,310
well but and I can because I have to put
 

53
00:01:59,310 --> 00:02:07,250
well but and I can because I have to put
another piece of floor here

54
00:02:07,250 --> 00:02:07,260

 

55
00:02:07,260 --> 00:02:11,460

if I I'm probably gonna have to cut this

56
00:02:11,460 --> 00:02:11,470
if I I'm probably gonna have to cut this
 

57
00:02:11,470 --> 00:02:15,540
if I I'm probably gonna have to cut this
out and then like it make a little

58
00:02:15,540 --> 00:02:15,550
out and then like it make a little
 

59
00:02:15,550 --> 00:02:18,150
out and then like it make a little
square or something to see how far it's

60
00:02:18,150 --> 00:02:18,160
square or something to see how far it's
 

61
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:21,000
square or something to see how far it's
wet and then puts another piece of wood

62
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:21,010
wet and then puts another piece of wood
 

63
00:02:21,010 --> 00:02:24,690
wet and then puts another piece of wood
in its place but how do I know where the

64
00:02:24,690 --> 00:02:24,700
in its place but how do I know where the
 

65
00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:26,310
in its place but how do I know where the
water's coming from it doesn't make any

66
00:02:26,310 --> 00:02:26,320
water's coming from it doesn't make any
 

67
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:26,850
water's coming from it doesn't make any
sense

68
00:02:26,850 --> 00:02:26,860
