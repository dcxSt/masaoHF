00:15:59,560 --> 00:16:02,100
STD and you go to a doctor you don't you
it's nothing so it's the same thing with

326
00:16:02,100 --> 00:16:02,110
it's nothing so it's the same thing with
 

327
00:16:02,110 --> 00:16:04,290
it's nothing so it's the same thing with
picking and it smells bad and you think

328
00:16:04,290 --> 00:16:04,300
picking and it smells bad and you think
 

329
00:16:04,300 --> 00:16:06,570
picking and it smells bad and you think
maybe it's gonna taste bad but then it

330
00:16:06,570 --> 00:16:06,580
maybe it's gonna taste bad but then it
 

331
00:16:06,580 --> 00:16:08,190
maybe it's gonna taste bad but then it
actually tastes good even if it smells

332
00:16:08,190 --> 00:16:08,200
actually tastes good even if it smells
 

333
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:20,790
