00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:05,180

I see philosophy is a battle between

2
00:00:05,180 --> 00:00:05,190
I see philosophy is a battle between
 

3
00:00:05,190 --> 00:00:12,589
I see philosophy is a battle between
hard and soft and I'm not talking about

4
00:00:12,589 --> 00:00:12,599
hard and soft and I'm not talking about
 

5
00:00:12,599 --> 00:00:17,660
hard and soft and I'm not talking about
porn here I'm talking about the ability

6
00:00:17,660 --> 00:00:17,670
porn here I'm talking about the ability
 

7
00:00:17,670 --> 00:00:25,480
porn here I'm talking about the ability
to see existence as waves you know waves

8
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:25,490
to see existence as waves you know waves
 

9
00:00:25,490 --> 00:00:33,670
to see existence as waves you know waves
rather than shapes and here's an example

10
00:00:33,670 --> 00:00:33,680
rather than shapes and here's an example
 

11
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:36,670
rather than shapes and here's an example
when you try to find the ultimate truth

12
00:00:36,670 --> 00:00:36,680
when you try to find the ultimate truth
 

13
00:00:36,680 --> 00:00:40,100
when you try to find the ultimate truth
the limit that language imposes on you

14
00:00:40,100 --> 00:00:40,110
the limit that language imposes on you
 

15
00:00:40,110 --> 00:00:43,010
the limit that language imposes on you
is a limit of shapes so you have the

16
00:00:43,010 --> 00:00:43,020
is a limit of shapes so you have the
 

17
00:00:43,020 --> 00:00:47,060
is a limit of shapes so you have the
shape for example like this this

18
00:00:47,060 --> 00:00:47,070
shape for example like this this
 

19
00:00:47,070 --> 00:00:54,400
shape for example like this this
represents good and this represents evil

20
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:54,410
represents good and this represents evil
 

21
00:00:54,410 --> 00:00:59,569
represents good and this represents evil
and you see these shapes straight in

22
00:00:59,569 --> 00:00:59,579
and you see these shapes straight in
 

23
00:00:59,579 --> 00:01:05,090
and you see these shapes straight in
your mind and events actions what you

24
00:01:05,090 --> 00:01:05,100
your mind and events actions what you
 

25
00:01:05,100 --> 00:01:09,649
your mind and events actions what you
see you interpret according to these two

26
00:01:09,649 --> 00:01:09,659
see you interpret according to these two
 

27
00:01:09,659 --> 00:01:14,060
see you interpret according to these two
shapes and some actions correspond to

28
00:01:14,060 --> 00:01:14,070
shapes and some actions correspond to
 

29
00:01:14,070 --> 00:01:16,880
shapes and some actions correspond to
this one others to this one they're

30
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:16,890
this one others to this one they're
 

31
00:01:16,890 --> 00:01:23,289
this one others to this one they're
absolute shapes but then the soft

32
00:01:23,289 --> 00:01:23,299
absolute shapes but then the soft
 

33
00:01:23,299 --> 00:01:29,770
absolute shapes but then the soft
philosophy is to see actions like this

34
00:01:29,770 --> 00:01:29,780
philosophy is to see actions like this
 

35
00:01:29,780 --> 00:01:37,750
philosophy is to see actions like this
waves go one way another

36
00:01:37,750 --> 00:01:37,760

 

37
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:42,880

a continuous flow that doesn't stop and

00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:42,890
a continuous flow that doesn't stop and
 

39
00:01:42,890 --> 00:01:49,950
a continuous flow that doesn't stop and
here you focus on this part right here

goes up shifts to the left so you say

42
00:01:59,770 --> 00:01:59,780
goes up shifts to the left so you say
 

43
00:01:59,780 --> 00:02:10,270

this is good you take ideal form the

44
00:02:10,270 --> 00:02:10,280
this is good you take ideal form the
 

45
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:14,710
this is good you take ideal form the
hard form and you interpret reality

46
00:02:14,710 --> 00:02:14,720
hard form and you interpret reality
 

47
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:18,160
hard form and you interpret reality
according to it and that is your limit

48
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:18,170
according to it and that is your limit
 

49
00:02:18,170 --> 00:02:21,280
according to it and that is your limit
of language what you see here you can

50
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:21,290
of language what you see here you can
 

51
00:02:21,290 --> 00:02:24,940
of language what you see here you can
only relate by giving it a form that

52
00:02:24,940 --> 00:02:24,950
only relate by giving it a form that
 

53
00:02:24,950 --> 00:02:27,850
only relate by giving it a form that
already existed beforehand therefore it

54
00:02:27,850 --> 00:02:27,860
already existed beforehand therefore it
 

55
00:02:27,860 --> 00:02:29,890
already existed beforehand therefore it
can never be had person accurately say

56
00:02:29,890 --> 00:02:29,900
can never be had person accurately say
 

57
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:31,480
can never be had person accurately say
this is a good action this is a bad

58
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:31,490
this is a good action this is a bad
 

59
00:02:31,490 --> 00:02:33,550
this is a good action this is a bad
action and that's the only way you can

60
00:02:33,550 --> 00:02:33,560
action and that's the only way you can
 

61
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:36,699
action and that's the only way you can
describe it to someone else but then

62
00:02:36,699 --> 00:02:36,709
describe it to someone else but then
 

63
00:02:36,709 --> 00:02:38,320
describe it to someone else but then
someone can come and tell you well no

64
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:38,330
someone can come and tell you well no
 

65
00:02:38,330 --> 00:02:41,680
someone can come and tell you well no
it's not necessarily good because here

66
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:41,690
it's not necessarily good because here
 

67
00:02:41,690 --> 00:02:43,740
it's not necessarily good because here
instead of being straight up and kind of

68
00:02:43,740 --> 00:02:43,750
instead of being straight up and kind of
 

69
00:02:43,750 --> 00:02:45,310
instead of being straight up and kind of
turn like that

70
00:02:45,310 --> 00:02:45,320
turn like that
 

71
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:48,100
turn like that
but then it didn't have a sharp angle

72
00:02:48,100 --> 00:02:48,110
but then it didn't have a sharp angle
 

73
00:02:48,110 --> 00:02:51,100
but then it didn't have a sharp angle
here it kind of moved in like this a

74
00:02:51,100 --> 00:02:51,110
here it kind of moved in like this a
 

75
00:02:51,110 --> 00:02:53,380
here it kind of moved in like this a
little bit and then what's even worse is

76
00:02:53,380 --> 00:02:53,390
little bit and then what's even worse is
 

77
00:02:53,390 --> 00:02:57,340
little bit and then what's even worse is
that you know when it goes on all of a

78
00:02:57,340 --> 00:02:57,350
that you know when it goes on all of a
 

79
00:02:57,350 --> 00:03:01,420
that you know when it goes on all of a
sudden it can turn to the other side and

80
00:03:01,420 --> 00:03:01,430
sudden it can turn to the other side and
 

81
00:03:01,430 --> 00:03:05,020
sudden it can turn to the other side and
whoopsie focus on something else and you

82
00:03:05,020 --> 00:03:05,030
whoopsie focus on something else and you
 

83
00:03:05,030 --> 00:03:10,690
whoopsie focus on something else and you
say something is evil that's something

84
00:03:10,690 --> 00:03:10,700
say something is evil that's something
 

85
00:03:10,700 --> 00:03:14,740
say something is evil that's something
that is fundamentally artificial it is

86
00:03:14,740 --> 00:03:14,750
that is fundamentally artificial it is
 

87
00:03:14,750 --> 00:03:19,840
that is fundamentally artificial it is
counterintuitive it's not human and you

88
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:19,850
counterintuitive it's not human and you
 

89
00:03:19,850 --> 00:03:24,400
counterintuitive it's not human and you
see this in a form of bureaucracy where

90
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:24,410
see this in a form of bureaucracy where
 

91
00:03:24,410 --> 00:03:26,500
see this in a form of bureaucracy where
everything has to be predetermined

92
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:26,510
everything has to be predetermined
 

93
00:03:26,510 --> 00:03:28,920
everything has to be predetermined
instead of being analyzed for why it is

94
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:28,930
instead of being analyzed for why it is
 

95
00:03:28,930 --> 00:03:36,550
instead of being analyzed for why it is
and that's why all the words in every

96
00:03:36,550 --> 00:03:36,560
and that's why all the words in every
 

97
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:40,990
and that's why all the words in every
language that we have give us the same

98
00:03:40,990 --> 00:03:41,000
language that we have give us the same
 

99
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:50,010
language that we have give us the same
restriction we are trained to see shapes

100
00:03:50,010 --> 00:03:50,020

 

101
00:03:50,020 --> 00:03:55,870

and everything that we see everything

102
00:03:55,870 --> 00:03:55,880
and everything that we see everything
 

103
00:03:55,880 --> 00:04:00,160
and everything that we see everything
that we hear or smell we insert it in

104
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:00,170
that we hear or smell we insert it in
 

105
00:04:00,170 --> 00:04:03,930
that we hear or smell we insert it in
one of these shapes and separate them so

106
00:04:03,930 --> 00:04:03,940
one of these shapes and separate them so
 

107
00:04:03,940 --> 00:04:08,290
one of these shapes and separate them so
while you see we have a tree and we have

108
00:04:08,290 --> 00:04:08,300
while you see we have a tree and we have
 

109
00:04:08,300 --> 00:04:11,650
while you see we have a tree and we have
the branches they have the roots and

110
00:04:11,650 --> 00:04:11,660
the branches they have the roots and
 

111
00:04:11,660 --> 00:04:15,599
the branches they have the roots and
leaves each of them are specific things

112
00:04:15,599 --> 00:04:15,609
leaves each of them are specific things
 

113
00:04:15,609 --> 00:04:19,270
leaves each of them are specific things
that in our mind we have all these

114
00:04:19,270 --> 00:04:19,280
that in our mind we have all these
 

115
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:20,800
that in our mind we have all these
little shapes that we've learned and

116
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:20,810
little shapes that we've learned and
 

117
00:04:20,810 --> 00:04:24,100
little shapes that we've learned and
when we receive the information we put

118
00:04:24,100 --> 00:04:24,110
when we receive the information we put
 

119
00:04:24,110 --> 00:04:26,980
when we receive the information we put
what we see in one of these shapes and

120
00:04:26,980 --> 00:04:26,990
what we see in one of these shapes and
 

121
00:04:26,990 --> 00:04:30,130
what we see in one of these shapes and
we cut off what we don't understand what

122
00:04:30,130 --> 00:04:30,140
we cut off what we don't understand what
 

123
00:04:30,140 --> 00:04:32,430
we cut off what we don't understand what
we haven't been trained to understand

124
00:04:32,430 --> 00:04:32,440
we haven't been trained to understand
 

125
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:37,720
we haven't been trained to understand
but in reality the tree we see it's all

126
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:37,730
but in reality the tree we see it's all
 

127
00:04:37,730 --> 00:04:41,320
but in reality the tree we see it's all
a continuous flow of movement that's a

128
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:41,330
a continuous flow of movement that's a
 

129
00:04:41,330 --> 00:04:44,460
a continuous flow of movement that's a
flow of energy and there is no place

130
00:04:44,460 --> 00:04:44,470
flow of energy and there is no place
 

131
00:04:44,470 --> 00:04:49,210
flow of energy and there is no place
specifically where you could say that

132
00:04:49,210 --> 00:04:49,220
specifically where you could say that
 

133
00:04:49,220 --> 00:04:53,040
specifically where you could say that
the tree ends and the soil begins

134
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:53,050
the tree ends and the soil begins
 

135
00:04:53,050 --> 00:04:56,710
the tree ends and the soil begins
because it's all flowing like that you

136
00:04:56,710 --> 00:04:56,720
because it's all flowing like that you
 

137
00:04:56,720 --> 00:05:01,390
because it's all flowing like that you
cannot separate it and say here's a tree

138
00:05:01,390 --> 00:05:01,400
cannot separate it and say here's a tree
 

139
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:04,420
cannot separate it and say here's a tree
here's the soil there's nothing in

140
00:05:04,420 --> 00:05:04,430
here's the soil there's nothing in
 

141
00:05:04,430 --> 00:05:06,510
here's the soil there's nothing in
between there's this perfect separation

00:05:06,510 --> 00:05:06,520
between there's this perfect separation

between there's this perfect separation
it doesn't exist all existence is waves

144
00:05:12,659 --> 00:05:12,669
it doesn't exist all existence is waves
 

145
00:05:12,669 --> 00:05:17,710
it doesn't exist all existence is waves
not shapes and that's why a syllogisms

146
00:05:17,710 --> 00:05:17,720
not shapes and that's why a syllogisms
 

147
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:22,990
not shapes and that's why a syllogisms
and all the foundation of our philosophy

148
00:05:22,990 --> 00:05:23,000
and all the foundation of our philosophy
 

149
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,960
and all the foundation of our philosophy
for hundreds of years everything that

150
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:25,970
for hundreds of years everything that
 

151
00:05:25,970 --> 00:05:28,920
for hundreds of years everything that
has shaped our way of thinking is wrong

152
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:28,930
has shaped our way of thinking is wrong
 

153
00:05:28,930 --> 00:05:34,110
has shaped our way of thinking is wrong
because we see shapes instead of waves

154
00:05:34,110 --> 00:05:34,120
because we see shapes instead of waves

00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:37,659
because we see shapes instead of waves
something is either good or evil some

have good people and bad people you have
the victim and the criminal you have the

162
00:05:47,590 --> 00:05:47,600
the victim and the criminal you have the
 

163
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:50,580
the victim and the criminal you have the
rich and the poor

164
00:05:50,580 --> 00:05:50,590
rich and the poor
 

165
00:05:50,590 --> 00:05:54,060
rich and the poor
but all these dualities are false

166
00:05:54,060 --> 00:05:54,070
but all these dualities are false
 

167
00:05:54,070 --> 00:05:59,350
but all these dualities are false
because they give hard shapes to a soft

168
00:05:59,350 --> 00:05:59,360
because they give hard shapes to a soft

171
00:06:01,699 --> 00:06:04,779
substance that does not fit into these

00:06:04,779 --> 00:06:04,789
shapes and so we have trained ourselves
 

173
00:06:04,789 --> 00:06:08,649
shapes and so we have trained ourselves
to think not only not as humans but as

00:06:08,649 --> 00:06:08,659
to think not only not as humans but as
 

175
00:06:08,659 --> 00:06:14,429
to think not only not as humans but as
machines as artificial beings and well

176
00:06:14,429 --> 00:06:14,439
machines as artificial beings and well
 

177
00:06:14,439 --> 00:06:20,920
machines as artificial beings and well
it's it's a shame but whatever who gives
