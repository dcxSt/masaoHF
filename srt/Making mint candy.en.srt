okay I think I just found something

2
00:00:08,629 --> 00:00:08,639
okay I think I just found something
 

3
00:00:08,639 --> 00:00:12,620
okay I think I just found something
amazing follow the way to make candies

4
00:00:12,620 --> 00:00:12,630
amazing follow the way to make candies
 

5
00:00:12,630 --> 00:00:16,430
amazing follow the way to make candies
and it's just something special and I'm

6
00:00:16,430 --> 00:00:16,440
and it's just something special and I'm
 

7
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:17,689
and it's just something special and I'm
going to show you how to do it but it

8
00:00:17,689 --> 00:00:17,699
going to show you how to do it but it
 

9
00:00:17,699 --> 00:00:20,660
going to show you how to do it but it
takes a little while first thing is

10
00:00:20,660 --> 00:00:20,670
takes a little while first thing is
 

11
00:00:20,670 --> 00:00:27,620
takes a little while first thing is
we're going to eat ice but not this this

12
00:00:27,620 --> 00:00:27,630
we're going to eat ice but not this this
 

13
00:00:27,630 --> 00:00:54,310
we're going to eat ice but not this this
is no good so we pick this out the water

14
00:00:54,310 --> 00:00:54,320

 

15
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:58,970

just like a little bit okay now we have

16
00:00:58,970 --> 00:00:58,980
just like a little bit okay now we have
 

17
00:00:58,980 --> 00:01:15,070
just like a little bit okay now we have
the bottom thingy there wait you may be

18
00:01:15,070 --> 00:01:15,080
the bottom thingy there wait you may be
 

19
00:01:15,080 --> 00:01:25,700
the bottom thingy there wait you may be
okay

20
00:01:25,700 --> 00:01:25,710

 

21
00:01:25,710 --> 00:01:28,370

has to be about equal amount of water in

22
00:01:28,370 --> 00:01:28,380
has to be about equal amount of water in
 

23
00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:33,740
has to be about equal amount of water in
each holder but it has to be just a

24
00:01:33,740 --> 00:01:33,750
each holder but it has to be just a
 

25
00:01:33,750 --> 00:01:41,830
each holder but it has to be just a
little bit just like okay

26
00:01:41,830 --> 00:01:41,840

 

27
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:47,240

Bibi is a little bit more okay I think

28
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:47,250
Bibi is a little bit more okay I think
 

29
00:01:47,250 --> 00:01:51,940
Bibi is a little bit more okay I think
that's okay that's pretty much it so

30
00:01:51,940 --> 00:01:51,950
that's okay that's pretty much it so
 

31
00:01:51,950 --> 00:01:54,590
that's okay that's pretty much it so
we're going to put this in the freezer

32
00:01:54,590 --> 00:01:54,600
we're going to put this in the freezer
 

33
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:57,530
we're going to put this in the freezer
overnight so we're going to have

34
00:01:57,530 --> 00:01:57,540
overnight so we're going to have
 

35
00:01:57,540 --> 00:02:00,320
overnight so we're going to have
tomorrow morning is you know we're going

tomorrow morning is you know we're going
 

37
00:02:00,330 --> 00:02:02,090
tomorrow morning is you know we're going
to have just a little bottom that's

38
00:02:02,090 --> 00:02:02,100
to have just a little bottom that's
 

39
00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:04,700
to have just a little bottom that's
going to be frozen and we're going to

40
00:02:04,700 --> 00:02:04,710
going to be frozen and we're going to
 

41
00:02:04,710 --> 00:02:09,800
going to be frozen and we're going to
make the candies from that so well it's

42
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:09,810
make the candies from that so well it's
 

43
00:02:09,810 --> 00:02:13,100
make the candies from that so well it's
still no the night here so see you

44
00:02:13,100 --> 00:02:13,110
still no the night here so see you
 

45
00:02:13,110 --> 00:02:18,979
still no the night here so see you
tomorrow here we have ice and if you can

46
00:02:18,979 --> 00:02:18,989
tomorrow here we have ice and if you can
 

47
00:02:18,989 --> 00:02:25,009
tomorrow here we have ice and if you can
see that right up there's just a small

48
00:02:25,009 --> 00:02:25,019
see that right up there's just a small
 

49
00:02:25,019 --> 00:02:29,000
see that right up there's just a small
layer of ice and right at the bottom so

50
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:29,010
layer of ice and right at the bottom so
 

51
00:02:29,010 --> 00:02:32,150
layer of ice and right at the bottom so
what we're going to do now put this back

52
00:02:32,150 --> 00:02:32,160
what we're going to do now put this back
 

53
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:36,020
what we're going to do now put this back
or front now we're going to use a cup

54
00:02:36,020 --> 00:02:36,030
or front now we're going to use a cup
 

55
00:02:36,030 --> 00:02:47,979
or front now we're going to use a cup
like that as a measurement and might

56
00:02:47,979 --> 00:02:47,989

 

57
00:02:47,989 --> 00:02:53,750

here we're going to make Mike candy so

58
00:02:53,750 --> 00:02:53,760
here we're going to make Mike candy so
 

59
00:02:53,760 --> 00:03:01,880
here we're going to make Mike candy so
we're gonna open ah but this been having

60
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:01,890
we're gonna open ah but this been having
 

61
00:03:01,890 --> 00:03:07,370
we're gonna open ah but this been having
some fainting spells recently really

62
00:03:07,370 --> 00:03:07,380
some fainting spells recently really
 

63
00:03:07,380 --> 00:03:10,699
some fainting spells recently really
feel kind of weird sometimes you know

64
00:03:10,699 --> 00:03:10,709
feel kind of weird sometimes you know
 

65
00:03:10,709 --> 00:03:13,520
feel kind of weird sometimes you know
like I'd be walking towards a

66
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:13,530
like I'd be walking towards a
 

67
00:03:13,530 --> 00:03:18,620
like I'd be walking towards a
supermarket and you know I'm gonna go to

68
00:03:18,620 --> 00:03:18,630
supermarket and you know I'm gonna go to
 

69
00:03:18,630 --> 00:03:21,020
supermarket and you know I'm gonna go to
supermarket one by something as I'm

70
00:03:21,020 --> 00:03:21,030
supermarket one by something as I'm
 

71
00:03:21,030 --> 00:03:22,670
supermarket one by something as I'm
walking and walking and then all of a

72
00:03:22,670 --> 00:03:22,680
walking and walking and then all of a

75
00:03:25,620 --> 00:03:29,030
sudden I realized that you know oh my
god I just got past a supermarket and

76
00:03:29,030 --> 00:03:29,040
god I just got past a supermarket and
 

77
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:34,699
god I just got past a supermarket and
then it's like yeah that was like

78
00:03:34,699 --> 00:03:34,709
then it's like yeah that was like
 

79
00:03:34,709 --> 00:03:37,990
then it's like yeah that was like
up I walked a mile past it

80
00:03:37,990 --> 00:03:38,000
up I walked a mile past it
 

81
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,330
up I walked a mile past it
and it happens sometimes a moment like

82
00:03:40,330 --> 00:03:40,340
and it happens sometimes a moment like
 

83
00:03:40,340 --> 00:03:42,160
and it happens sometimes a moment like
that and I just I don't even realize it

84
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:42,170
that and I just I don't even realize it
 

85
00:03:42,170 --> 00:03:44,470
that and I just I don't even realize it
I just like it's like if I get in a

86
00:03:44,470 --> 00:03:44,480
I just like it's like if I get in a
 

87
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:47,350
I just like it's like if I get in a
trance and my thoughts get locked out or

88
00:03:47,350 --> 00:03:47,360
trance and my thoughts get locked out or
 

89
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:53,650
trance and my thoughts get locked out or
something and like I don't even remember

90
00:03:53,650 --> 00:03:53,660
something and like I don't even remember
 

91
00:03:53,660 --> 00:03:56,080
something and like I don't even remember
walking in front of supermarket was like

92
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:56,090
walking in front of supermarket was like
 

93
00:03:56,090 --> 00:03:59,670
walking in front of supermarket was like
I know I did just melt right into it and

94
00:03:59,670 --> 00:03:59,680
I know I did just melt right into it and
 

95
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:02,280
I know I did just melt right into it and
so what i'm doing here is i'm putting

96
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:02,290
so what i'm doing here is i'm putting
 

97
00:04:02,290 --> 00:04:07,890
so what i'm doing here is i'm putting
kind of a mixture of mind and water and

98
00:04:07,890 --> 00:04:07,900

 

99
00:04:07,900 --> 00:04:09,940

it's difficult to find the right

100
00:04:09,940 --> 00:04:09,950
it's difficult to find the right
 

101
00:04:09,950 --> 00:04:15,550
it's difficult to find the right
combination there should be you know at

102
00:04:15,550 --> 00:04:15,560
combination there should be you know at
 

103
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:20,740
combination there should be you know at
least a decent amount of mind and maybe

104
00:04:20,740 --> 00:04:20,750
least a decent amount of mind and maybe
 

105
00:04:20,750 --> 00:04:23,380
least a decent amount of mind and maybe
even more mind than water but if it's

106
00:04:23,380 --> 00:04:23,390
even more mind than water but if it's
 

107
00:04:23,390 --> 00:04:27,780
even more mind than water but if it's
too much no good what happens is that

108
00:04:27,780 --> 00:04:27,790
too much no good what happens is that
 

109
00:04:27,790 --> 00:04:29,950
too much no good what happens is that
we're going to make the candies in the

110
00:04:29,950 --> 00:04:29,960
we're going to make the candies in the
 

111
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:31,810
we're going to make the candies in the
freezer right so if we put too much

112
00:04:31,810 --> 00:04:31,820
freezer right so if we put too much
 

113
00:04:31,820 --> 00:04:35,530
freezer right so if we put too much
water the candies are not going to work

114
00:04:35,530 --> 00:04:35,540
water the candies are not going to work
 

115
00:04:35,540 --> 00:04:38,470
water the candies are not going to work
out well because what's going to happen

116
00:04:38,470 --> 00:04:38,480
out well because what's going to happen
 

117
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:41,830
out well because what's going to happen
is that they're going to be too hard but

118
00:04:41,830 --> 00:04:41,840
is that they're going to be too hard but
 

119
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:47,400
is that they're going to be too hard but
if it's a good mixture of mind and water

120
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:47,410
if it's a good mixture of mind and water
 

121
00:04:47,410 --> 00:04:50,980
if it's a good mixture of mind and water
then when it freezes is it's going to

122
00:04:50,980 --> 00:04:50,990
then when it freezes is it's going to
 

123
00:04:50,990 --> 00:04:53,980
then when it freezes is it's going to
solidify it's not going to be like ice

124
00:04:53,980 --> 00:04:53,990
solidify it's not going to be like ice
 

125
00:04:53,990 --> 00:04:57,070
solidify it's not going to be like ice
it's gonna be soft I know it's going to

126
00:04:57,070 --> 00:04:57,080
it's gonna be soft I know it's going to
 

127
00:04:57,080 --> 00:04:59,920
it's gonna be soft I know it's going to
be like you know like maybe on a sponge

128
00:04:59,920 --> 00:04:59,930
be like you know like maybe on a sponge
 

129
00:04:59,930 --> 00:05:02,500
be like you know like maybe on a sponge
but like I stopped together you can you

130
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:02,510
but like I stopped together you can you
 

131
00:05:02,510 --> 00:05:03,900
but like I stopped together you can you
know kind of squeeze a little but

132
00:05:03,900 --> 00:05:03,910
know kind of squeeze a little but
 

133
00:05:03,910 --> 00:05:06,280
know kind of squeeze a little but
because the mind doesn't get doesn't

134
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:06,290
because the mind doesn't get doesn't
 

135
00:05:06,290 --> 00:05:16,030
because the mind doesn't get doesn't
turn into ice king

136
00:05:16,030 --> 00:05:16,040

 

137
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:24,189

let's see

138
00:05:24,189 --> 00:05:24,199

 

139
00:05:24,199 --> 00:05:41,880

some weird physics things going on

140
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:41,890

 

141
00:05:41,890 --> 00:05:44,400

ah that's what's not supposed to happen

142
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:44,410
ah that's what's not supposed to happen
 

143
00:05:44,410 --> 00:05:47,370
ah that's what's not supposed to happen
that's the danger the little ice thing

144
00:05:47,370 --> 00:05:47,380
that's the danger the little ice thing
 

145
00:05:47,380 --> 00:05:49,590
that's the danger the little ice thing
coming up so this one's going to be

146
00:05:49,590 --> 00:05:49,600
coming up so this one's going to be
 

147
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:57,120
coming up so this one's going to be
ruined but the other is my copy okay

148
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:57,130
ruined but the other is my copy okay
 

149
00:05:57,130 --> 00:06:36,140
ruined but the other is my copy okay
let's keep going

150
00:06:36,140 --> 00:06:36,150

 

151
00:06:36,150 --> 00:06:38,010

yeah I should have put more water

152
00:06:38,010 --> 00:06:38,020
yeah I should have put more water
 

153
00:06:38,020 --> 00:06:40,860
yeah I should have put more water
yesterday because the little thingies

154
00:06:40,860 --> 00:06:40,870
yesterday because the little thingies
 

155
00:06:40,870 --> 00:06:43,530
yesterday because the little thingies
are popping up at the surface watch or

156
00:06:43,530 --> 00:06:43,540
are popping up at the surface watch or
 

157
00:06:43,540 --> 00:06:47,670
are popping up at the surface watch or
the other because I wasn't it wasn't

158
00:06:47,670 --> 00:06:47,680
the other because I wasn't it wasn't
 

159
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:50,490
