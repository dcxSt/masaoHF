oh friend just give me this new coffee
machine let's try this see if I can set

4
00:00:10,669 --> 00:00:10,679
machine let's try this see if I can set
 

5
00:00:10,679 --> 00:00:14,110
machine let's try this see if I can set
up apparently it's really good

6
00:00:14,110 --> 00:00:14,120
up apparently it's really good
 

7
00:00:14,120 --> 00:00:26,180
up apparently it's really good
let's see how it works now

8
00:00:26,180 --> 00:00:26,190

 

9
00:00:26,190 --> 00:00:31,340

so this is an instruction manual I don't

10
00:00:31,340 --> 00:00:31,350
so this is an instruction manual I don't
 

11
00:00:31,350 --> 00:00:33,640
so this is an instruction manual I don't
know why it would be an Italian but

12
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:33,650
know why it would be an Italian but
 

13
00:00:33,650 --> 00:01:32,530
know why it would be an Italian but
whatever okay

14
00:01:32,530 --> 00:01:32,540

oh that's amazing I have to go back home
to get the converter plug where the hell

28
00:03:57,250 --> 00:03:57,260
to get the converter plug where the hell
 

29
00:03:57,260 --> 00:03:59,140
to get the converter plug where the hell

converter but it's broken see there's a
 

45
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:28,740
converter but it's broken see there's a
little thingy there in it and besides

46
00:04:28,740 --> 00:04:28,750
little thingy there in it and besides
 

47
00:04:28,750 --> 00:04:35,620
little thingy there in it and besides
what I also learned this because this

48
00:04:35,620 --> 00:04:35,630
what I also learned this because this
 

49
00:04:35,630 --> 00:04:44,140
what I also learned this because this
thing yeah okay so 120 volts that's good

50
00:04:44,140 --> 00:04:44,150
thing yeah okay so 120 volts that's good
 

51
00:04:44,150 --> 00:04:47,110
thing yeah okay so 120 volts that's good
but it's a thousand watts and because

52
00:04:47,110 --> 00:04:47,120
but it's a thousand watts and because
 

53
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:49,120
but it's a thousand watts and because
it's a cakewalk I wouldn't have been

54
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:49,130
it's a cakewalk I wouldn't have been
 

55
00:04:49,130 --> 00:04:51,279
it's a cakewalk I wouldn't have been
able to use something like this in the

56
00:04:51,279 --> 00:04:51,289
able to use something like this in the
 

57
00:04:51,289 --> 00:05:11,709
able to use something like this in the
first place

58
00:05:11,709 --> 00:05:11,719

 

59
00:05:11,719 --> 00:05:13,730

apparently I would need a bigger machine

60
00:05:13,730 --> 00:05:13,740
apparently I would need a bigger machine
 

61
00:05:13,740 --> 00:09:01,930
apparently I would need a bigger machine
to be able to use it so let's see

62
00:09:01,930 --> 00:09:01,940

 

63
00:09:01,940 --> 00:09:07,360

I guess it's too small

64
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:07,370
I guess it's too small
 

65
00:09:07,370 --> 00:09:10,310

yeah I was able to push it in had to be

66
00:09:10,310 --> 00:09:10,320

put this here and look I'm supposed to
push the button when I wanted to make

100
00:15:24,030 --> 00:15:24,040
push the button when I wanted to make
 

101
00:15:24,040 --> 00:15:41,280
push the button when I wanted to make
the call

102
