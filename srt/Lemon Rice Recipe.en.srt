inside and we're going to take half a
 

15
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:35,090
inside and we're going to take half a
cup of rice of you can use a cup like

milliliters but you can just instantly

20
00:00:50,139 --> 00:00:50,149

 

21
00:00:50,149 --> 00:00:53,510

41
00:02:04,380 --> 00:02:09,600
later and so in 15 minutes we'll have
the rise that that will be ready so

42
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:09,610
the rise that that will be ready so
 

43
00:02:09,610 --> 00:02:12,930
the rise that that will be ready so
we're going to start this up always make

44
00:02:12,930 --> 00:02:12,940
we're going to start this up always make
 

45
00:02:12,940 --> 00:02:15,440

can catch fire underneath here sometimes

48
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:18,730
can catch fire underneath here sometimes
 

49
00:02:18,730 --> 00:02:21,120
can catch fire underneath here sometimes
it happens you know when I hear the

50
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:21,130
it happens you know when I hear the
 

51
00:02:21,130 --> 00:02:23,660
it happens you know when I hear the
whole thing on and you know this

52
00:02:23,660 --> 00:02:23,670
whole thing on and you know this
 

53
00:02:23,670 --> 00:02:27,930
whole thing on and you know this
whatever you know what happens when

54
00:02:27,930 --> 00:02:27,940
whatever you know what happens when
 

55
00:02:27,940 --> 00:02:31,740
whatever you know what happens when
you're cooking the rice some little

56
00:02:31,740 --> 00:02:31,750
you're cooking the rice some little
 

57
00:02:31,750 --> 00:02:34,830
you're cooking the rice some little
things are going to fall on the side and

58
00:02:34,830 --> 00:02:34,840
things are going to fall on the side and
 

59
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:37,800
things are going to fall on the side and
it's going to accumulate around this you

60
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:37,810
it's going to accumulate around this you
 

61
00:02:37,810 --> 00:02:39,870
it's going to accumulate around this you
know you know when you cook rice like

62
00:02:39,870 --> 00:02:39,880
know you know when you cook rice like
 

63
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:43,560
know you know when you cook rice like
every day eventually uh you know there's

64
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:43,570
every day eventually uh you know there's
 

65
00:02:43,570 --> 00:02:45,870
every day eventually uh you know there's
a big accumulation and it can catch fire

66
00:02:45,870 --> 00:02:45,880
a big accumulation and it can catch fire
 

67
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:48,210
a big accumulation and it can catch fire
so you should clean this stuff regularly

68
00:02:48,210 --> 00:02:48,220
so you should clean this stuff regularly
 

69
00:02:48,220 --> 00:02:51,740
so you should clean this stuff regularly
so we're gonna turn it on at maximum

70
00:02:51,740 --> 00:02:51,750
so we're gonna turn it on at maximum
 

71
00:02:51,750 --> 00:02:56,820
so we're gonna turn it on at maximum
intensity and it's gonna be about 13 or

72
00:02:56,820 --> 00:02:56,830
intensity and it's gonna be about 13 or
 

73
00:02:56,830 --> 00:03:00,080
intensity and it's gonna be about 13 or
14 minutes and it's gonna be ready okay

74
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:00,090
14 minutes and it's gonna be ready okay
 

75
00:03:00,090 --> 00:03:03,150
14 minutes and it's gonna be ready okay
so it's just about ready so we're going

usually do this with two hands but what

88
00:03:35,759 --> 00:03:35,769
usually do this with two hands but what
 

89
00:03:35,769 --> 00:03:38,330
usually do this with two hands but what
I'm gonna have to do this off camera

90
00:03:38,330 --> 00:03:38,340
I'm gonna have to do this off camera
 

91
00:03:38,340 --> 00:03:47,470
I'm gonna have to do this off camera
okay chop this thing

92
00:03:47,470 --> 00:03:47,480

 

93
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:49,369

now we're going to need this little

94
00:03:49,369 --> 00:03:49,379
now we're going to need this little
 

95
00:03:49,379 --> 00:04:11,619
now we're going to need this little
machine now that takes the juice okay

96
00:04:11,619 --> 00:04:11,629

 

97
00:04:11,629 --> 00:04:16,210

then we need a spoon

98
00:04:16,210 --> 00:04:16,220

 

99
00:04:16,220 --> 00:04:40,500

so just half

100
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:40,510

 

101
00:04:40,510 --> 00:04:55,510

it's very much alright

102
00:04:55,510 --> 00:04:55,520

 

103
00:04:55,520 --> 00:05:00,970

so like I said to see that little blue

104
00:05:00,970 --> 00:05:00,980
so like I said to see that little blue
 

105
00:05:00,980 --> 00:05:04,660
so like I said to see that little blue
thingy is always falling off the side so

106
00:05:04,660 --> 00:05:04,670
thingy is always falling off the side so
 

107
00:05:04,670 --> 00:05:07,350
thingy is always falling off the side so
you have to clean the pot every time but

108
00:05:07,350 --> 00:05:07,360
you have to clean the pot every time but
 

109
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:10,950
you have to clean the pot every time but
one way it falls down it accumulates

110
00:05:10,950 --> 00:05:10,960
one way it falls down it accumulates
 

111
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:14,410
one way it falls down it accumulates
underneath you know so sometimes you

112
00:05:14,410 --> 00:05:14,420
underneath you know so sometimes you
 

113
00:05:14,420 --> 00:05:18,070
underneath you know so sometimes you
have the stuff that accumulates it

114
00:05:18,070 --> 00:05:18,080
have the stuff that accumulates it
 

115
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:19,690
have the stuff that accumulates it
starts to catch fire

116
00:05:19,690 --> 00:05:19,700
starts to catch fire
 

117
00:05:19,700 --> 00:05:22,540
starts to catch fire
so now you just went to all the bubbles

118
00:05:22,540 --> 00:05:22,550
so now you just went to all the bubbles
 

119
00:05:22,550 --> 00:05:24,940
so now you just went to all the bubbles
to go away and whenever I'm doing this

120
00:05:24,940 --> 00:05:24,950
to go away and whenever I'm doing this
 

121
00:05:24,950 --> 00:05:26,530
to go away and whenever I'm doing this
I'm always afraid that the whole thing's

122
00:05:26,530 --> 00:05:26,540
I'm always afraid that the whole thing's
 

123
00:05:26,540 --> 00:05:28,930
I'm always afraid that the whole thing's
gonna explode because it does you know

124
00:05:28,930 --> 00:05:28,940
gonna explode because it does you know
 

125
00:05:28,940 --> 00:05:30,670
gonna explode because it does you know
that it's glass and it's getting very

126
00:05:30,670 --> 00:05:30,680
that it's glass and it's getting very
 

127
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:32,260
that it's glass and it's getting very
hot so I mean at some point it's just

128
00:05:32,260 --> 00:05:32,270
hot so I mean at some point it's just
 

129
00:05:32,270 --> 00:05:34,000
hot so I mean at some point it's just
going to crack and explode in my face or

130
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:34,010
going to crack and explode in my face or
 

131
00:05:34,010 --> 00:05:37,900
going to crack and explode in my face or
something you can turn on the the air

132
00:05:37,900 --> 00:05:37,910
something you can turn on the the air
 

133
00:05:37,910 --> 00:05:49,219
something you can turn on the the air
thingy okay so it's almost done

134
00:05:49,219 --> 00:05:49,229

 

135
00:05:49,229 --> 00:05:59,100

when pill is no more water

136
00:05:59,100 --> 00:05:59,110

 

137
00:05:59,110 --> 00:06:02,249

okay that's pretty much it so turn this

138
00:06:02,249 --> 00:06:02,259
okay that's pretty much it so turn this
 

139
00:06:02,259 --> 00:06:12,840
okay that's pretty much it so turn this
off here

140
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:12,850

 

141
00:06:12,850 --> 00:06:21,750

the lemon juice you mix it up and then

142
00:06:21,750 --> 00:06:21,760
the lemon juice you mix it up and then
 

143
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:28,470
the lemon juice you mix it up and then
you let it rest for about 10 minutes so

144
00:06:28,470 --> 00:06:28,480
you let it rest for about 10 minutes so
 

145
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:31,440
you let it rest for about 10 minutes so
we'll just wait about 10 minutes and and

146
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:31,450
we'll just wait about 10 minutes and and
 

147
00:06:31,450 --> 00:06:34,650
we'll just wait about 10 minutes and and
and while you're waiting put the stuff

148
00:06:34,650 --> 00:06:34,660
and while you're waiting put the stuff
 

149
00:06:34,660 --> 00:06:38,220
and while you're waiting put the stuff
back on so wait with the collar on for

150
00:06:38,220 --> 00:06:38,230
back on so wait with the collar on for
 

151
00:06:38,230 --> 00:06:43,620
back on so wait with the collar on for
10 minutes all right well it's been 10

152
00:06:43,620 --> 00:06:43,630
10 minutes all right well it's been 10
 

153
00:06:43,630 --> 00:06:53,660
10 minutes all right well it's been 10
minutes so you remove the cover and

154
00:06:53,660 --> 00:06:53,670

 

155
00:06:53,670 --> 00:06:55,980

that's very very good best way to make

156
00:06:55,980 --> 00:06:55,990
that's very very good best way to make
 

157
00:06:55,990 --> 00:07:01,260
that's very very good best way to make
rice you know maybe a little bit too

158
00:07:01,260 --> 00:07:01,270
rice you know maybe a little bit too
 

159
00:07:01,270 --> 00:07:04,920
rice you know maybe a little bit too
much lemon I usually make more than half
