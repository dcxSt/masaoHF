97
00:05:57,659 --> 00:06:00,230
understand I'm going to show you a
little bit of an example here let's say

98
00:06:00,230 --> 00:06:00,240
little bit of an example here let's say
 

99
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:06,110
little bit of an example here let's say
that you have an object that looks like

100
00:06:06,110 --> 00:06:06,120
that you have an object that looks like
 

101
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:09,800
that you have an object that looks like
this okay but in order for that object

102
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:09,810
this okay but in order for that object
 

103
00:06:09,810 --> 00:06:12,680
this okay but in order for that object
to okay let's say this is how it's sold

104
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:12,690
to okay let's say this is how it's sold
 

105
00:06:12,690 --> 00:06:15,469
to okay let's say this is how it's sold
as when you buy Lotus like this but for

106
00:06:15,469 --> 00:06:15,479
as when you buy Lotus like this but for
 

107
00:06:15,479 --> 00:06:17,570
as when you buy Lotus like this but for
that object to be used for the purpose

108
00:06:17,570 --> 00:06:17,580
that object to be used for the purpose
 

109
00:06:17,580 --> 00:06:20,089
that object to be used for the purpose
in which to it's just going to be used

110
00:06:20,089 --> 00:06:20,099
in which to it's just going to be used
 

111
00:06:20,099 --> 00:06:23,869
in which to it's just going to be used
for there has to be a little hole like

112
00:06:23,869 --> 00:06:23,879
for there has to be a little hole like
 

113
00:06:23,879 --> 00:06:27,620
for there has to be a little hole like
that

114
00:06:27,620 --> 00:06:27,630

 

115
00:06:27,630 --> 00:06:31,040

and so you have an object another object

116
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:31,050
and so you have an object another object
 

117
00:06:31,050 --> 00:06:34,430
and so you have an object another object
that is sold separately that has this

118
00:06:34,430 --> 00:06:34,440
that is sold separately that has this
 

119
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:38,720
that is sold separately that has this
shape and this object let's say this is

120
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:38,730
shape and this object let's say this is
 

121
00:06:38,730 --> 00:06:42,470
shape and this object let's say this is
called a object eight that's the name of

122
00:06:42,470 --> 00:06:42,480
called a object eight that's the name of
 

123
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:44,060
called a object eight that's the name of
the thing with metaphorically speaking

124
00:06:44,060 --> 00:06:44,070
the thing with metaphorically speaking
 

125
00:06:44,070 --> 00:06:47,950
the thing with metaphorically speaking
so let's say that this is called a

126
00:06:47,950 --> 00:06:47,960
so let's say that this is called a
 

127
00:06:47,960 --> 00:07:01,239
so let's say that this is called a
machine that is a an a-hole maker

128
00:07:01,239 --> 00:07:01,249

 

129
00:07:01,249 --> 00:07:03,729

because the purpose of this slow thingy

130
00:07:03,729 --> 00:07:03,739
because the purpose of this slow thingy
 

131
00:07:03,739 --> 00:07:07,269
because the purpose of this slow thingy
there is to make the hole in this object

132
00:07:07,269 --> 00:07:07,279
there is to make the hole in this object
 

133
00:07:07,279 --> 00:07:11,559
there is to make the hole in this object
to make it useful and so when you have

134
00:07:11,559 --> 00:07:11,569
to make it useful and so when you have
 

135
00:07:11,569 --> 00:07:15,249
to make it useful and so when you have
something like this people are

136
00:07:15,249 --> 00:07:15,259
something like this people are
 

137
00:07:15,259 --> 00:07:18,429
something like this people are
brainwashed into not saying what

138
00:07:18,429 --> 00:07:18,439
brainwashed into not saying what
 

139
00:07:18,439 --> 00:07:22,389
brainwashed into not saying what
actually makes that thing but to see it

140
00:07:22,389 --> 00:07:22,399
actually makes that thing but to see it
 

141
00:07:22,399 --> 00:07:25,779
actually makes that thing but to see it
as simply what the description makes it

142
00:07:25,779 --> 00:07:25,789
as simply what the description makes it
 

143
00:07:25,789 --> 00:07:28,419
as simply what the description makes it
out to be something that is made

144
00:07:28,419 --> 00:07:28,429
out to be something that is made
 

145
00:07:28,429 --> 00:07:30,959
out to be something that is made
purposely for the objective of creating

146
00:07:30,959 --> 00:07:30,969
purposely for the objective of creating
 

147
00:07:30,969 --> 00:07:37,149
purposely for the objective of creating
this hole in the subject and so it seems

148
00:07:37,149 --> 00:07:37,159
this hole in the subject and so it seems
 

149
00:07:37,159 --> 00:07:42,819
this hole in the subject and so it seems
that you know when someone like me or

150
00:07:42,819 --> 00:07:42,829
that you know when someone like me or
 

151
00:07:42,829 --> 00:07:47,379
that you know when someone like me or
whoever else uses this object for a

152
00:07:47,379 --> 00:07:47,389
whoever else uses this object for a
 

153
00:07:47,389 --> 00:07:49,929
whoever else uses this object for a
different purpose say like you have

154
00:07:49,929 --> 00:07:49,939
different purpose say like you have
 

155
00:07:49,939 --> 00:07:54,850
different purpose say like you have
water and you need the water to flow to

156
00:07:54,850 --> 00:07:54,860
water and you need the water to flow to
 

157
00:07:54,860 --> 00:07:56,529
water and you need the water to flow to
a certain point but not further and you

158
00:07:56,529 --> 00:07:56,539
a certain point but not further and you
 

159
00:07:56,539 --> 00:07:59,109
a certain point but not further and you
take this object and you put it like

160
00:07:59,109 --> 00:07:59,119
take this object and you put it like
 

161
00:07:59,119 --> 00:08:04,209
take this object and you put it like
this but just so that ever since it goes

162
