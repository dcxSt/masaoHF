1
00:00:00,920 --> 00:00:03,949

okay it's been a while since I made any

2
00:00:03,949 --> 00:00:03,959
okay it's been a while since I made any
 

3
00:00:03,959 --> 00:00:07,099
okay it's been a while since I made any
new videos there's one thing that I was

4
00:00:07,099 --> 00:00:07,109
new videos there's one thing that I was
 

5
00:00:07,109 --> 00:00:10,940
new videos there's one thing that I was
kind of wondering it's about how to make

6
00:00:10,940 --> 00:00:10,950
kind of wondering it's about how to make
 

7
00:00:10,950 --> 00:00:23,300
kind of wondering it's about how to make
oil specifically peanut oil and here's

8
00:00:23,300 --> 00:00:23,310
oil specifically peanut oil and here's
 

9
00:00:23,310 --> 00:00:35,470
oil specifically peanut oil and here's
the thing if you think peanuts

10
00:00:35,470 --> 00:00:35,480

 

11
00:00:35,480 --> 00:00:53,540

yeah the mystery is this yeah okay open

12
00:00:53,540 --> 00:00:53,550
yeah the mystery is this yeah okay open
 

13
00:00:53,550 --> 00:01:15,660
yeah the mystery is this yeah okay open
this up

14
00:01:15,660 --> 00:01:15,670

 

15
00:01:15,670 --> 00:01:29,770

how do you go from this did this all

16
00:01:29,770 --> 00:01:29,780
how do you go from this did this all
 

17
00:01:29,780 --> 00:01:38,950
how do you go from this did this all
liquidy and I mean it just doesn't say

18
00:01:38,950 --> 00:01:38,960
liquidy and I mean it just doesn't say
 

19
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:46,210
liquidy and I mean it just doesn't say
here any oil will burn if overheated the

20
00:01:46,210 --> 00:01:46,220
here any oil will burn if overheated the
 

21
00:01:46,220 --> 00:01:54,940
here any oil will burn if overheated the
I figure that up hard way yeah so it

22
00:01:54,940 --> 00:01:54,950
I figure that up hard way yeah so it
 

23
00:01:54,950 --> 00:02:04,100
I figure that up hard way yeah so it
doesn't say anything

24
00:02:04,100 --> 00:02:04,110

 

25
00:02:04,110 --> 00:02:06,540

not Canada does taste like peanuts

26
00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:06,550
not Canada does taste like peanuts
 

27
00:02:06,550 --> 00:02:08,940
not Canada does taste like peanuts
that's well it that's what it is like

28
00:02:08,940 --> 00:02:08,950
that's well it that's what it is like
 

29
00:02:08,950 --> 00:02:35,570
that's well it that's what it is like
liquid peanuts

30
00:02:35,570 --> 00:02:35,580

 

31
00:02:35,580 --> 00:02:37,940

since they're both peanuts I guess maybe

32
00:02:37,940 --> 00:02:37,950
since they're both peanuts I guess maybe
 

33
00:02:37,950 --> 00:02:42,530
since they're both peanuts I guess maybe
if I put it here I can do some kind of

34
00:02:42,530 --> 00:02:42,540
if I put it here I can do some kind of
 

35
00:02:42,540 --> 00:02:47,170
if I put it here I can do some kind of
mechanical element experiment thing

36
00:02:47,170 --> 00:02:47,180
mechanical element experiment thing
 

37
00:02:47,180 --> 00:02:53,120
mechanical element experiment thing
might make the peanut merge with the

38
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:53,130
might make the peanut merge with the
 

39
00:02:53,130 --> 00:02:54,980
might make the peanut merge with the
other stuff that's former peanuts you

40
00:02:54,980 --> 00:02:54,990
other stuff that's former peanuts you
 

41
00:02:54,990 --> 00:02:57,530
other stuff that's former peanuts you
know that was transformed into some kind

42
00:02:57,530 --> 00:02:57,540
know that was transformed into some kind
 

43
00:02:57,540 --> 00:03:04,100
know that was transformed into some kind
of a liquidy stuff substance thing yeah

44
00:03:04,100 --> 00:03:04,110
of a liquidy stuff substance thing yeah
 

45
00:03:04,110 --> 00:03:14,300
of a liquidy stuff substance thing yeah
I don't get it I mean I can get you know

46
00:03:14,300 --> 00:03:14,310
I don't get it I mean I can get you know
 

47
00:03:14,310 --> 00:03:16,310
I don't get it I mean I can get you know
all those because you just crushed them

48
00:03:16,310 --> 00:03:16,320
all those because you just crushed them
 

49
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:19,400
all those because you just crushed them
and yeah it's kind of squishy and

50
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:19,410
and yeah it's kind of squishy and
 

51
00:03:19,410 --> 00:03:21,410
and yeah it's kind of squishy and
everything so it's no wonder would be

52
00:03:21,410 --> 00:03:21,420
everything so it's no wonder would be
 

53
00:03:21,420 --> 00:03:26,870
everything so it's no wonder would be
made into uh into peanuts liquid thing

54
00:03:26,870 --> 00:03:26,880
made into uh into peanuts liquid thing
 

55
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:48,589
made into uh into peanuts liquid thing
there

56
00:03:48,589 --> 00:03:48,599

 

57
00:03:48,599 --> 00:03:50,880

this shouldn't make these holes easier

58
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:50,890
this shouldn't make these holes easier
 

59
00:03:50,890 --> 00:03:54,179
this shouldn't make these holes easier
to put things and the objective of a

60
00:03:54,179 --> 00:03:54,189
to put things and the objective of a
 

61
00:03:54,189 --> 00:04:09,190
to put things and the objective of a
poll is to put stuff and you know

62
00:04:09,190 --> 00:04:09,200

 

63
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:16,870

I don't see it's kind of getting shiny

64
00:04:16,870 --> 00:04:16,880
I don't see it's kind of getting shiny
 

65
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:20,650
I don't see it's kind of getting shiny
you can see the little you know on the

66
00:04:20,650 --> 00:04:20,660
you can see the little you know on the
 

67
00:04:20,660 --> 00:04:23,140
you can see the little you know on the
peanut the little thingies that kind of

68
00:04:23,140 --> 00:04:23,150
peanut the little thingies that kind of
 

69
00:04:23,150 --> 00:04:35,760
peanut the little thingies that kind of
shine there whatever storage dolmens

70
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:35,770

 

71
00:04:35,770 --> 00:04:39,370

close well

72
00:04:39,370 --> 00:04:39,380

 

73
00:04:39,380 --> 00:04:46,010

so lots are exactly what's happening way

74
00:04:46,010 --> 00:04:46,020
so lots are exactly what's happening way
 

75
00:04:46,020 --> 00:04:48,620
so lots are exactly what's happening way
the transformations probably occurs you

76
00:04:48,620 --> 00:04:48,630
the transformations probably occurs you
 

77
00:04:48,630 --> 00:04:50,570
the transformations probably occurs you
know where you where you got that the my

78
00:04:50,570 --> 00:04:50,580
know where you where you got that the my
 

79
00:04:50,580 --> 00:04:54,950
know where you where you got that the my
poems so I'll try to push the peanut you

80
00:04:54,950 --> 00:04:54,960
poems so I'll try to push the peanut you
 

81
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:59,780
poems so I'll try to push the peanut you
know to the place where there's a little

82
00:04:59,780 --> 00:04:59,790
know to the place where there's a little
 

83
00:04:59,790 --> 00:05:03,500
know to the place where there's a little
bulbs there that are going off where

84
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:03,510
bulbs there that are going off where
 

85
00:05:03,510 --> 00:05:07,130
bulbs there that are going off where
there's one on the other side there it

86
00:05:07,130 --> 00:05:07,140
there's one on the other side there it
 

87
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:13,610
there's one on the other side there it
is it's going to keep it in the bolts

88
00:05:13,610 --> 00:05:13,620
is it's going to keep it in the bolts
 

89
00:05:13,620 --> 00:05:15,320
is it's going to keep it in the bolts
because that's the hottest area

90
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:15,330
because that's the hottest area
 

91
00:05:15,330 --> 00:05:21,040
because that's the hottest area
I think wind chill transformation

92
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:21,050

 

93
00:05:21,050 --> 00:05:23,120

well me the only way you can make

94
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:23,130
well me the only way you can make
 

95
00:05:23,130 --> 00:05:25,970
well me the only way you can make
something liquid is heat right I mean

96
00:05:25,970 --> 00:05:25,980
something liquid is heat right I mean
 

97
00:05:25,980 --> 00:05:28,430
something liquid is heat right I mean
think something solid and it's like you

98
00:05:28,430 --> 00:05:28,440
think something solid and it's like you
 

99
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:32,330
think something solid and it's like you
know the low atoms that are rounded like

100
00:05:32,330 --> 00:05:32,340
know the low atoms that are rounded like
 

101
00:05:32,340 --> 00:05:33,470
know the low atoms that are rounded like
that are making it

102
00:05:33,470 --> 00:05:33,480
that are making it
 

103
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:36,020
that are making it
they're turning and the faster they turn

104
00:05:36,020 --> 00:05:36,030
they're turning and the faster they turn
 

105
00:05:36,030 --> 00:05:39,350
they're turning and the faster they turn
that the more the softer they get you

106
00:05:39,350 --> 00:05:39,360
that the more the softer they get you
 

107
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:41,270
that the more the softer they get you
know so like if they get like really

108
00:05:41,270 --> 00:05:41,280
know so like if they get like really
 

109
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:43,580
know so like if they get like really
really fast it turns liquid and then

110
00:05:43,580 --> 00:05:43,590
really fast it turns liquid and then
 

111
00:05:43,590 --> 00:05:47,740
really fast it turns liquid and then
gets faster faster it becomes gas so I

112
00:05:47,740 --> 00:05:47,750
gets faster faster it becomes gas so I
 

113
00:05:47,750 --> 00:05:49,820
gets faster faster it becomes gas so I
suppose that's what they did they kind

114
00:05:49,820 --> 00:05:49,830
suppose that's what they did they kind
 

115
00:05:49,830 --> 00:05:53,420
suppose that's what they did they kind
of yeah they heated the peanuts to make

116
00:05:53,420 --> 00:05:53,430
of yeah they heated the peanuts to make
 

117
00:05:53,430 --> 00:05:57,380
of yeah they heated the peanuts to make
them liquid but then the problem is that

118
00:05:57,380 --> 00:05:57,390
them liquid but then the problem is that
 

119
00:05:57,390 --> 00:05:59,180
them liquid but then the problem is that
they stayed leak with even at normal

120
00:05:59,180 --> 00:05:59,190
they stayed leak with even at normal
 

121
00:05:59,190 --> 00:06:02,090
they stayed leak with even at normal
temperature after that so they probably

122
00:06:02,090 --> 00:06:02,100
temperature after that so they probably
 

123
00:06:02,100 --> 00:06:04,820
temperature after that so they probably
added some something like they might

124
00:06:04,820 --> 00:06:04,830
added some something like they might
 

125
00:06:04,830 --> 00:06:07,580
added some something like they might
have eaten or something I don't know not

126
00:06:07,580 --> 00:06:07,590
have eaten or something I don't know not
 

127
00:06:07,590 --> 00:06:11,930
have eaten or something I don't know not
to make it set its face liquid whoa whoa

128
00:06:11,930 --> 00:06:11,940
to make it set its face liquid whoa whoa
 

129
00:06:11,940 --> 00:06:14,420
to make it set its face liquid whoa whoa
oh whoa oh I hate that

130
00:06:14,420 --> 00:06:14,430
oh whoa oh I hate that
 

131
00:06:14,430 --> 00:06:17,100
oh whoa oh I hate that
Oh

132
00:06:17,100 --> 00:06:17,110

 

133
00:06:17,110 --> 00:06:34,690

oh yeah

134
00:06:34,690 --> 00:06:34,700

 

135
00:06:34,700 --> 00:06:53,710

Wow holy wait a minute

136
00:06:53,710 --> 00:06:53,720

 

137
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:58,490

well this only happened to me I wonder

138
00:06:58,490 --> 00:06:58,500
well this only happened to me I wonder
 

139
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:15,460
well this only happened to me I wonder
how many people died making this stuff

140
00:07:15,460 --> 00:07:15,470

 

141
00:07:15,470 --> 00:07:41,560

that officious dangerous yow

142
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:41,570

 

143
00:07:41,570 --> 00:07:52,860

oh okay so yeah that was a failure

144
00:07:52,860 --> 00:07:52,870

 

145
00:07:52,870 --> 00:07:56,350

yeah that's the thing with oil it's just

146
00:07:56,350 --> 00:07:56,360
yeah that's the thing with oil it's just
 

147
00:07:56,360 --> 00:07:58,420
yeah that's the thing with oil it's just
blows up in your face when you try to

148
00:07:58,420 --> 00:07:58,430
blows up in your face when you try to
 

149
00:07:58,430 --> 00:08:12,310
blows up in your face when you try to
get it like in Iraq you know on paper so

150
00:08:12,310 --> 00:08:12,320
get it like in Iraq you know on paper so
 

151
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:18,250
get it like in Iraq you know on paper so
yeah I'm not made out to be a cook but

152
00:08:18,250 --> 00:08:18,260
yeah I'm not made out to be a cook but
 

153
00:08:18,260 --> 00:08:22,390
yeah I'm not made out to be a cook but
um I guess it's kind of like trial and

154
00:08:22,390 --> 00:08:22,400
um I guess it's kind of like trial and
 

155
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:26,260
um I guess it's kind of like trial and
error you know I got a you got to suffer

156
00:08:26,260 --> 00:08:26,270
error you know I got a you got to suffer
 

157
00:08:26,270 --> 00:08:30,520
error you know I got a you got to suffer
to learn stuff so something like that I

158
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:30,530
to learn stuff so something like that I
 

159
00:08:30,530 --> 00:08:34,150
to learn stuff so something like that I
guess anyway so I'm gonna go back to

160
00:08:34,150 --> 00:08:34,160
guess anyway so I'm gonna go back to
 

161
00:08:34,160 --> 00:08:38,890
guess anyway so I'm gonna go back to
sleep or something ah good night or

162
00:08:38,890 --> 00:08:38,900
sleep or something ah good night or
 

163
00:08:38,900 --> 00:08:41,349
sleep or something ah good night or
something
