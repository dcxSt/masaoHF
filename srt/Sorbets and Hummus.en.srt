early 90s I think I'm not sure when it
 

205
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:54,339
early 90s I think I'm not sure when it
was but then I you know I hadn't had any

206
00:07:54,339 --> 00:07:54,349

00:08:00,070 --> 00:08:00,080
didn't I thought it was just this
 

211
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:02,890
didn't I thought it was just this
restaurant that made it but then I

212
00:08:02,890 --> 00:08:02,900
restaurant that made it but then I
 

213
00:08:02,900 --> 00:08:06,129
restaurant that made it but then I
realized when I saw this at Costco they

214
00:08:06,129 --> 00:08:06,139
realized when I saw this at Costco they
 

215
00:08:06,139 --> 00:08:10,059
realized when I saw this at Costco they
were selling you know packages with

with the cooler for the computer because

386
00:12:42,350 --> 00:12:42,360
with the cooler for the computer because
 

387
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:45,650
with the cooler for the computer because
when you have a processor and a computer

388
00:12:45,650 --> 00:12:45,660
when you have a processor and a computer
 

389
00:12:45,660 --> 00:12:47,990
when you have a processor and a computer
it's a guess like really really hot so

390
00:12:47,990 --> 00:12:48,000
it's a guess like really really hot so
 

391
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:51,380
it's a guess like really really hot so
you have to buy a cooler to keep it cold

392
00:12:51,380 --> 00:12:51,390
you have to buy a cooler to keep it cold
 

393
00:12:51,390 --> 00:12:57,890
you have to buy a cooler to keep it cold
and when I bought this brand and what

394
00:12:57,890 --> 00:12:57,900
and when I bought this brand and what
 

395
00:12:57,900 --> 00:12:59,300
and when I bought this brand and what
happens is that there's a thermal

396
00:12:59,300 --> 00:12:59,310
happens is that there's a thermal
 

397
00:12:59,310 --> 00:13:02,329
happens is that there's a thermal
compound scammed like a little goo ish

398
00:13:02,329 --> 00:13:02,339
compound scammed like a little goo ish
 

399
00:13:02,339 --> 00:13:05,750
compound scammed like a little goo ish
based that you between the processor and

400
00:13:05,750 --> 00:13:05,760
based that you between the processor and
 

401
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:07,430
based that you between the processor and
the cooler so that the heat gets

402
00:13:07,430 --> 00:13:07,440
the cooler so that the heat gets
 

403
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:09,890
the cooler so that the heat gets
transferred right and the thing is that

404
00:13:09,890 --> 00:13:09,900
transferred right and the thing is that
 

405
00:13:09,900 --> 00:13:12,800
transferred right and the thing is that
and in that little thingy you don't have

406
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:12,810
and in that little thingy you don't have
 

407
00:13:12,810 --> 00:13:14,720
and in that little thingy you don't have
to put it because it's already on there

408
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:14,730
to put it because it's already on there
