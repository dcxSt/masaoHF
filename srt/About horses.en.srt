horse meat is a lot more leanness got
 

47
00:01:15,119 --> 00:01:20,330

00:01:23,359 --> 00:01:23,369
protein do but it's it's very similar
 

51
00:01:23,369 --> 00:01:26,600
protein do but it's it's very similar
but here's the thing if you buy a horse

52
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:26,610
but here's the thing if you buy a horse
 

53
00:01:26,610 --> 00:01:28,550
but here's the thing if you buy a horse
meat that the price is about the same as

54
00:01:28,550 --> 00:01:28,560
meat that the price is about the same as
 

55
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:31,940
meat that the price is about the same as
as if you are buying beef okay it's it

56
00:01:31,940 --> 00:01:31,950
as if you are buying beef okay it's it
 

57
00:01:31,950 --> 00:01:38,359
as if you are buying beef okay it's it
it doesn't really cost more but the

58
00:01:38,359 --> 00:01:38,369
it doesn't really cost more but the
 

59
00:01:38,369 --> 00:01:40,039
it doesn't really cost more but the
thing is that you get more bang for your

60
00:01:40,039 --> 00:01:40,049
thing is that you get more bang for your
 

61
00:01:40,049 --> 00:01:43,100
thing is that you get more bang for your
buck with horse meat and the reason for

62
00:01:43,100 --> 00:01:43,110
buck with horse meat and the reason for
 

63
00:01:43,110 --> 00:01:47,870
buck with horse meat and the reason for
that is actually very simple what

64
00:01:47,870 --> 00:01:47,880
that is actually very simple what
 

65
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:50,210
that is actually very simple what
happens with horse meat is that well

66
00:01:50,210 --> 00:01:50,220
happens with horse meat is that well
 

67
00:01:50,220 --> 00:01:53,600
happens with horse meat is that well
with beef is that when you cook beef the

68
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:53,610
with beef is that when you cook beef the
 

69
00:01:53,610 --> 00:01:57,380
with beef is that when you cook beef the
volume of the meat goes down by I think

70
00:01:57,380 --> 00:01:57,390
volume of the meat goes down by I think
 

71
00:01:57,390 --> 00:01:59,870
volume of the meat goes down by I think
it may be even as much as 30 or 40

72
00:01:59,870 --> 00:01:59,880
it may be even as much as 30 or 40
 

73
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:02,120
it may be even as much as 30 or 40
percent you know for example if you

74
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:02,130
percent you know for example if you
 

75
00:02:02,130 --> 00:02:09,010
percent you know for example if you
think 250 grams of beef and you cook it

76
00:02:09,010 --> 00:02:09,020
think 250 grams of beef and you cook it
 

77
00:02:09,020 --> 00:02:11,540
think 250 grams of beef and you cook it
when you are actually going to eat it

78
00:02:11,540 --> 00:02:11,550
when you are actually going to eat it
 

79
00:02:11,550 --> 00:02:13,730
when you are actually going to eat it
you're not going to get 200

80
00:02:13,730 --> 00:02:13,740
you're not going to get 200
 

81
00:02:13,740 --> 00:02:15,830
you're not going to get 200
the grams it's gonna be something like I

82
00:02:15,830 --> 00:02:15,840
the grams it's gonna be something like I
 

83
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:22,520
the grams it's gonna be something like I
don't know maybe 200 grams or you know

84
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:22,530
don't know maybe 200 grams or you know
 

85
00:02:22,530 --> 00:02:24,700
don't know maybe 200 grams or you know
something like that it's not gonna be

86
00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:24,710
something like that it's not gonna be
 

87
00:02:24,710 --> 00:02:29,990
something like that it's not gonna be
anywhere near as much you know so anyway

88
00:02:29,990 --> 00:02:30,000
anywhere near as much you know so anyway
 

89
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,750
anywhere near as much you know so anyway
I'm trying to hurry up here because you

90
00:02:32,750 --> 00:02:32,760
I'm trying to hurry up here because you
 

91
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:34,400

I'm not a YouTube partner anymore so I

94
00:02:36,020 --> 00:02:36,030
I'm not a YouTube partner anymore so I
 

95
00:02:36,030 --> 00:02:39,200
I'm not a YouTube partner anymore so I
can't have a limited time for my video

96
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:39,210
can't have a limited time for my video
 

97
00:02:39,210 --> 00:02:41,540
can't have a limited time for my video
so I'm gonna have to you go as fast as

98
00:02:41,540 --> 00:02:41,550
so I'm gonna have to you go as fast as
 

99
00:02:41,550 --> 00:02:44,330
so I'm gonna have to you go as fast as
possible so obviously it's not gonna

100
00:02:44,330 --> 00:02:44,340
possible so obviously it's not gonna
 

101
00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:47,510
possible so obviously it's not gonna
come off to be very good but let's see

102
00:02:47,510 --> 00:02:47,520
come off to be very good but let's see
 

103
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:49,700
come off to be very good but let's see
what I can come up with try to figure

104
00:02:49,700 --> 00:02:49,710
what I can come up with try to figure
 

105
00:02:49,710 --> 00:02:51,290
what I can come up with try to figure
out more or less where the eyes are

106
00:02:51,290 --> 00:02:51,300
out more or less where the eyes are
 

107
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:53,780
out more or less where the eyes are
gonna fall and I think maybe the jaws

108
00:02:53,780 --> 00:02:53,790
gonna fall and I think maybe the jaws
 

109
00:02:53,790 --> 00:03:06,290
gonna fall and I think maybe the jaws
are the small here have the mouth here

110
00:03:06,290 --> 00:03:06,300
are the small here have the mouth here
 

111
00:03:06,300 --> 00:03:08,450
are the small here have the mouth here
and know if it looks like a mouth and

112
00:03:08,450 --> 00:03:08,460
and know if it looks like a mouth and
 

113
00:03:08,460 --> 00:03:09,550
and know if it looks like a mouth and
then when you try and draw something

114
00:03:09,550 --> 00:03:09,560
then when you try and draw something
 

115
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:12,680
then when you try and draw something
like if you want to draw a horse the way

116
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:12,690
like if you want to draw a horse the way
 

117
00:03:12,690 --> 00:03:14,360
like if you want to draw a horse the way
to tell if you're drawing a successful

118
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:14,370
to tell if you're drawing a successful
 

119
00:03:14,370 --> 00:03:16,970
to tell if you're drawing a successful
is if it looks like a horse now if you

120
00:03:16,970 --> 00:03:16,980
is if it looks like a horse now if you
 

121
00:03:16,980 --> 00:03:18,440
is if it looks like a horse now if you
try to draw a horse and looks like a

122
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:18,450
try to draw a horse and looks like a
 

123
00:03:18,450 --> 00:03:21,650
try to draw a horse and looks like a
rabbit you know then that's not good but

124

rabbit you know then that's not good but
 

125
00:03:21,660 --> 00:03:23,300
rabbit you know then that's not good but
if it looks like a horse then what

126
00:03:23,300 --> 00:03:23,310
if it looks like a horse then what
 

127
00:03:23,310 --> 00:03:26,360
if it looks like a horse then what
that's okay and now I don't have enough

128
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:26,370
that's okay and now I don't have enough
 

129
00:03:26,370 --> 00:03:29,570
that's okay and now I don't have enough
space in the paper so the nose is a bit

130
00:03:29,570 --> 00:03:29,580
space in the paper so the nose is a bit
 

131
00:03:29,580 --> 00:03:31,910
space in the paper so the nose is a bit
too short but well it doesn't really

132
00:03:31,910 --> 00:03:31,920
too short but well it doesn't really
 

133
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:37,160
too short but well it doesn't really
matter anyway I will do what that to the
