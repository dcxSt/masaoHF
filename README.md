# Diagnosing Schitzophrenia using NLP : A case study.
The mysterious [masaoHF](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC3r7mjh3SsPw7xziKVqYYVQ) recently released a [seminal video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmWpbWMQPPU) in which he contemplates the uncertain future of Montreal. In this repository we question his sanity.

#### personal notes 
to conver from .vtt to .srt you can use the command 
ffmpeg -i video_subtitles.vtt output.srt

for downloading all of his stuff at once i used
youtube-dl --skip-download --write-auto-sub -o "%(title)s.%(ext)s" -v https://www.youtube.com/channel/U....etc.urlofchannel
