that you have an object that looks like
this<00:06:06.770><c> okay</c><00:06:07.849><c> but</c><00:06:08.849><c> in</c><00:06:09.000><c> order</c><00:06:09.150><c> for</c><00:06:09.300><c> that</c><00:06:09.509><c> object</c>

00:06:09.800 --> 00:06:09.810 align:start position:0%
this okay but in order for that object
 

00:06:09.810 --> 00:06:12.680 align:start position:0%
this okay but in order for that object
to<00:06:10.409><c> okay</c><00:06:11.340><c> let's</c><00:06:11.669><c> say</c><00:06:11.789><c> this</c><00:06:11.909><c> is</c><00:06:11.969><c> how</c><00:06:12.210><c> it's</c><00:06:12.419><c> sold</c>

00:06:12.680 --> 00:06:12.690 align:start position:0%
to okay let's say this is how it's sold
 

00:06:12.690 --> 00:06:15.469 align:start position:0%
to okay let's say this is how it's sold
as<00:06:12.900><c> when</c><00:06:13.169><c> you</c><00:06:13.259><c> buy</c><00:06:13.440><c> Lotus</c><00:06:13.860><c> like</c><00:06:14.069><c> this</c><00:06:14.280><c> but</c><00:06:15.270><c> for</c>

00:06:15.469 --> 00:06:15.479 align:start position:0%
as when you buy Lotus like this but for
 

00:06:15.479 --> 00:06:17.570 align:start position:0%
as when you buy Lotus like this but for
that<00:06:15.629><c> object</c><00:06:15.870><c> to</c><00:06:16.319><c> be</c><00:06:16.469><c> used</c><00:06:16.740><c> for</c><00:06:17.099><c> the</c><00:06:17.129><c> purpose</c>

00:06:17.570 --> 00:06:17.580 align:start position:0%
that object to be used for the purpose
 

00:06:17.580 --> 00:06:20.089 align:start position:0%
that object to be used for the purpose
in<00:06:17.699><c> which</c><00:06:17.849><c> to</c><00:06:18.060><c> it's</c><00:06:18.690><c> just</c><00:06:19.680><c> going</c><00:06:19.830><c> to</c><00:06:19.860><c> be</c><00:06:19.919><c> used</c>

00:06:20.089 --> 00:06:20.099 align:start position:0%
in which to it's just going to be used
 

00:06:20.099 --> 00:06:23.869 align:start position:0%
in which to it's just going to be used
for<00:06:20.330><c> there</c><00:06:21.330><c> has</c><00:06:21.509><c> to</c><00:06:21.810><c> be</c><00:06:21.840><c> a</c><00:06:21.990><c> little</c><00:06:22.610><c> hole</c><00:06:23.610><c> like</c>

00:06:23.869 --> 00:06:23.879 align:start position:0%
for there has to be a little hole like
 

00:06:23.879 --> 00:06:27.620 align:start position:0%
for there has to be a little hole like
that

00:06:27.620 --> 00:06:27.630 align:start position:0%
 
 

00:06:27.630 --> 00:06:31.040 align:start position:0%
 
and<00:06:27.750><c> so</c><00:06:28.650><c> you</c><00:06:29.220><c> have</c><00:06:29.400><c> an</c><00:06:29.580><c> object</c><00:06:30.120><c> another</c><00:06:30.780><c> object</c>

00:06:31.040 --> 00:06:31.050 align:start position:0%
and so you have an object another object
 

00:06:31.050 --> 00:06:34.430 align:start position:0%
and so you have an object another object
that<00:06:31.320><c> is</c><00:06:31.470><c> sold</c><00:06:31.710><c> separately</c><00:06:32.390><c> that</c><00:06:33.390><c> has</c><00:06:33.600><c> this</c>

00:06:34.430 --> 00:06:34.440 align:start position:0%
that is sold separately that has this
 

00:06:34.440 --> 00:06:38.720 align:start position:0%
that is sold separately that has this
shape<00:06:34.910><c> and</c><00:06:35.930><c> this</c><00:06:36.930><c> object</c><00:06:37.590><c> let's</c><00:06:38.370><c> say</c><00:06:38.490><c> this</c><00:06:38.670><c> is</c>

00:06:38.720 --> 00:06:38.730 align:start position:0%
shape and this object let's say this is
 

00:06:38.730 --> 00:06:42.470 align:start position:0%
shape and this object let's say this is
called<00:06:39.090><c> a</c><00:06:40.370><c> object</c><00:06:41.370><c> eight</c><00:06:41.910><c> that's</c><00:06:42.120><c> the</c><00:06:42.300><c> name</c><00:06:42.450><c> of</c>

00:06:42.470 --> 00:06:42.480 align:start position:0%
called a object eight that's the name of
 

00:06:42.480 --> 00:06:44.060 align:start position:0%
called a object eight that's the name of
the<00:06:42.720><c> thing</c><00:06:42.930><c> with</c><00:06:43.260><c> metaphorically</c><00:06:43.950><c> speaking</c>

00:06:44.060 --> 00:06:44.070 align:start position:0%
the thing with metaphorically speaking
 

00:06:44.070 --> 00:06:47.950 align:start position:0%
the thing with metaphorically speaking
so<00:06:44.820><c> let's</c><00:06:45.000><c> say</c><00:06:45.090><c> that</c><00:06:45.330><c> this</c><00:06:45.420><c> is</c><00:06:45.630><c> called</c><00:06:46.550><c> a</c>

00:06:47.950 --> 00:06:47.960 align:start position:0%
so let's say that this is called a
 

00:06:47.960 --> 00:07:01.239 align:start position:0%
so let's say that this is called a
machine<00:06:48.960><c> that</c><00:06:49.590><c> is</c><00:06:50.120><c> a</c><00:06:51.560><c> an</c><00:06:53.810><c> a-hole</c><00:06:57.500><c> maker</c>

00:07:01.239 --> 00:07:01.249 align:start position:0%
 
 

00:07:01.249 --> 00:07:03.729 align:start position:0%
 
because<00:07:01.999><c> the</c><00:07:02.089><c> purpose</c><00:07:02.299><c> of</c><00:07:02.719><c> this</c><00:07:02.779><c> slow</c><00:07:03.259><c> thingy</c>

00:07:03.729 --> 00:07:03.739 align:start position:0%
because the purpose of this slow thingy
 

00:07:03.739 --> 00:07:07.269 align:start position:0%
because the purpose of this slow thingy
there<00:07:04.209><c> is</c><00:07:05.209><c> to</c><00:07:05.509><c> make</c><00:07:05.719><c> the</c><00:07:05.929><c> hole</c><00:07:06.139><c> in</c><00:07:06.409><c> this</c><00:07:06.739><c> object</c>

00:07:07.269 --> 00:07:07.279 align:start position:0%
there is to make the hole in this object
 

00:07:07.279 --> 00:07:11.559 align:start position:0%
there is to make the hole in this object
to<00:07:07.399><c> make</c><00:07:07.609><c> it</c><00:07:07.759><c> useful</c><00:07:08.419><c> and</c><00:07:09.609><c> so</c><00:07:10.609><c> when</c><00:07:11.269><c> you</c><00:07:11.389><c> have</c>

00:07:11.559 --> 00:07:11.569 align:start position:0%
to make it useful and so when you have
 

00:07:11.569 --> 00:07:15.249 align:start position:0%
to make it useful and so when you have
something<00:07:11.869><c> like</c><00:07:12.019><c> this</c><00:07:13.989><c> people</c><00:07:14.989><c> are</c>

00:07:15.249 --> 00:07:15.259 align:start position:0%
something like this people are
 

00:07:15.259 --> 00:07:18.429 align:start position:0%
something like this people are
brainwashed<00:07:15.589><c> into</c><00:07:16.129><c> not</c><00:07:16.489><c> saying</c><00:07:17.439><c> what</c>

00:07:18.429 --> 00:07:18.439 align:start position:0%
brainwashed into not saying what
 

00:07:18.439 --> 00:07:22.389 align:start position:0%
brainwashed into not saying what
actually<00:07:18.979><c> makes</c><00:07:19.969><c> that</c><00:07:20.239><c> thing</c><00:07:20.479><c> but</c><00:07:21.409><c> to</c><00:07:21.649><c> see</c><00:07:22.249><c> it</c>

00:07:22.389 --> 00:07:22.399 align:start position:0%
actually makes that thing but to see it
 

00:07:22.399 --> 00:07:25.779 align:start position:0%
actually makes that thing but to see it
as<00:07:23.049><c> simply</c><00:07:24.049><c> what</c><00:07:24.379><c> the</c><00:07:24.469><c> description</c><00:07:25.099><c> makes</c><00:07:25.549><c> it</c>

00:07:25.779 --> 00:07:25.789 align:start position:0%
as simply what the description makes it
 

00:07:25.789 --> 00:07:28.419 align:start position:0%
as simply what the description makes it
out<00:07:25.909><c> to</c><00:07:25.939><c> be</c><00:07:26.589><c> something</c><00:07:27.589><c> that</c><00:07:27.949><c> is</c><00:07:28.099><c> made</c>

00:07:28.419 --> 00:07:28.429 align:start position:0%
out to be something that is made
 

00:07:28.429 --> 00:07:30.959 align:start position:0%
out to be something that is made
