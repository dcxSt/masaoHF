put two hard drives here but the thing
is<00:01:20.880><c> broken</c><00:01:21.180><c> so</c><00:01:22.110><c> I</c><00:01:22.170><c> have</c><00:01:22.350><c> to</c><00:01:22.560><c> put</c><00:01:22.860><c> my</c><00:01:23.040><c> hard</c>

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 align:start position:0%
is broken so I have to put my hard
 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:27.020 align:start position:0%
is broken so I have to put my hard
drives<00:01:23.990><c> outside</c><00:01:24.990><c> like</c><00:01:25.229><c> that</c><00:01:25.440><c> and</c><00:01:26.430><c> wire</c><00:01:26.790><c> them</c>

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:39.750 align:start position:0%
 
like<00:03:37.490><c> this</c><00:03:37.730><c> to</c><00:03:38.480><c> make</c><00:03:38.690><c> it</c><00:03:38.810><c> look</c><00:03:38.990><c> better</c><00:03:39.200><c> but</c>

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:39.760 align:start position:0%
like this to make it look better but
 

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:44.380 align:start position:0%
like this to make it look better but
yeah<00:03:40.760><c> hard</c><00:03:41.210><c> part</c><00:03:41.510><c> is</c><00:03:41.750><c> definitely</c><00:03:42.760><c> done</c><00:03:43.760><c> I</c>

00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:44.390 align:start position:0%
yeah hard part is definitely done I
 

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:47.980 align:start position:0%
yeah hard part is definitely done I
think<00:03:45.350><c> it</c><00:03:45.470><c> looks</c><00:03:45.650><c> quite</c><00:03:46.250><c> a</c><00:03:46.330><c> lot</c><00:03:47.330><c> better</c><00:03:47.630><c> and</c>

00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:47.990 align:start position:0%
think it looks quite a lot better and
 

00:03:47.990 --> 00:03:52.600 align:start position:0%
think it looks quite a lot better and
there's<00:03:48.580><c> underneath</c><00:03:50.560><c> you</c><00:03:51.560><c> know</c><00:03:51.620><c> about</c><00:03:52.100><c> you</c>

00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:52.610 align:start position:0%
there's underneath you know about you
 

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:55.990 align:start position:0%
there's underneath you know about you
know<00:03:52.730><c> five</c><00:03:53.000><c> or</c><00:03:53.210><c> six</c><00:03:53.980><c> steel</c><00:03:54.980><c> columns</c><00:03:55.550><c> holding</c>

00:03:55.990 --> 00:03:56.000 align:start position:0%
know five or six steel columns holding
 

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.330 align:start position:0%
know five or six steel columns holding
this<00:03:56.210><c> together</c><00:03:56.650><c> so</c><00:03:57.650><c> I</c><00:03:57.710><c> think</c><00:03:57.800><c> it's</c><00:03:58.100><c> pretty</c>

00:03:58.330 --> 00:03:58.340 align:start position:0%

you<00:12:48.270><c> have</c><00:12:48.390><c> to</c><00:12:48.540><c> buy</c><00:12:48.690><c> a</c><00:12:48.720><c> cooler</c><00:12:49.200><c> to</c><00:12:50.070><c> keep</c><00:12:51.000><c> it</c><00:12:51.150><c> cold</c>

00:12:51.380 --> 00:12:51.390 align:start position:0%
you have to buy a cooler to keep it cold
 

00:12:51.390 --> 00:12:57.890 align:start position:0%
you have to buy a cooler to keep it cold
and<00:12:52.070><c> when</c><00:12:53.070><c> I</c><00:12:53.100><c> bought</c><00:12:53.580><c> this</c><00:12:54.270><c> brand</c><00:12:55.190><c> and</c><00:12:56.900><c> what</c>
